H. pylori may also have a role in uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia, ulcer risk in patients taking low-dose aspirin or starting therapy with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. While choosing a treatment regimen for H. pylori, patients should be asked about previous antibiotic exposure and this information should be incorporated into the decision-making process. For first-line treatment, clarithromycin triple therapy should be confined to patients with no previous history of macrolide exposure who reside in areas where clarithromycin resistance amongst H. pylori isolates is known to be low. Most patients will be better served by first-line treatment with bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy consisting of a PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole. When first-line therapy fails, a salvage regimen should avoid antibiotics that were previously used. If a patient received a first-line treatment containing clarithromycin, bismuth quadruple therapy or levofloxacin salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options. If a patient received first-line bismuth quadruple therapy, clarithromycin or levofloxacin-containing salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options. Details regarding the drugs, doses and durations of the recommended and suggested first-line and salvage regimens can be found in the guideline."

Two important developments are associated with the decrease in rates of peptic ulcer disease: the discovery of effective and potent acid suppressants, and of Helicobacter pylori. With the discovery of H pylori infection, the causes, pathogenesis, and treatment of peptic ulcer disease have been rewritten. We focus on this revolution of understanding and management of peptic ulcer disease over the past years. Despite substantial advances, this disease remains an important clinical problem, largely because of the increasingly widespread use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and low-dose aspirin. We discuss the role of these agents in the causes of ulcer disease and therapeutic and preventive strategies for drug-induced ulcers. The rare but increasingly problematic H pylori-negative NSAID-negative ulcer is also examined."

Although lymphoma can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract, the most frequent sites in order of its occurrence are the stomach followed by small intestine and ileocecal region. Gastrointestinal tract lymphoma is usually secondary to the widespread nodal diseases and primary gastrointestinal tract lymphoma is relatively rare. Gastrointestinal lymphomas are usually not clinically specific and indistinguishable from other benign and malignant conditions. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common pathological type of gastrointestinal lymphoma in essentially all sites of the gastrointestinal tract, although recently the frequency of other forms has also increased in certain regions of the world. Although some radiological features such as bulky lymph nodes and maintenance of fat plane are more suggestive of lymphoma, they are not specific, thus mandating histopathological analysis for its definitive diagnosis. There has been a tremendous leap in the diagnosis, staging and management of gastrointestinal lymphoma in the last two decades attributed to a better insight into its etiology and molecular aspect as well as the knowledge about its critical signaling pathways."

Some populations that have a high prevalence of H. pylori infection also have a high incidence of gastric cancer (for example, in East Asia), whereas others do not (for example, in Africa and South Asia). Even within East Asia, the incidence of gastric cancer varies (decreasing in the south). H. pylori is a highly heterogeneous bacterium and its virulence varies geographically. Geographic differences in the incidence of gastric cancer can be explained, at least in part, by the presence of different types of H. pylori virulence factor, especially CagA, VacA and OipA. However, it is still unclear why the pathogenicity of H. pylori increased as it migrated from Africa to East Asia during the course of evolution. H. pylori infection is also thought to be involved in the development of duodenal ulcer, which is at the opposite end of the disease spectrum to gastric cancer. This discrepancy can be explained in part by the presence of H. pylori virulence factor DupA. Despite advances in our understanding of the development of H. pylori-related diseases, further work is required to clarify the roles of H. pylori virulence factors."

Species differences in embryonic development and architecture of the adult stomach make animal models suboptimal for studying human stomach organogenesis and pathogenesis, and there is no experimental model of normal human gastric mucosa. Here we report the de novo generation of three-dimensional human gastric tissue in vitro through the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. We show that temporal manipulation of the FGF, WNT, BMP, retinoic acid and EGF signalling pathways and three-dimensional growth are sufficient to generate human gastric organoids (hGOs). Developing hGOs progressed through molecular and morphogenetic stages that were nearly identical to the developing antrum of the mouse stomach. Organoids formed primitive gastric gland- and pit-like domains, proliferative zones containing LGR5-expressing cells, surface and antral mucous cells, and a diversity of gastric endocrine cells. We used hGO cultures to identify novel signalling mechanisms that regulate early endoderm patterning and gastric endocrine cell differentiation upstream of the transcription factor NEUROG3. Using hGOs to model pathogenesis of human disease, we found that H. pylori infection resulted in rapid association of the virulence factor CagA with the c-Met receptor, activation of signalling and induction of epithelial proliferation. Together, these studies describe a new and robust in vitro system for elucidating the mechanisms underlying human stomach development and disease."

Flavonoids are a family of plant-derived compounds with potentially exploitable activities, including direct antibacterial activity, synergism with antibiotics, and suppression of bacterial virulence. In this review, recent advances towards understanding these properties are described. Information is presented on the ten most potently antibacterial flavonoids as well as the five most synergistic flavonoid-antibiotic combinations tested in the last years (identified from PubMed and ScienceDirect). Top of these respective lists are panduratin A, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of - μg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus, and epicatechin gallate, which reduces oxacillin MICs as much as -fold. Research seeking to improve such activity and understand structure-activity relationships is discussed. Proposed mechanisms of action are also discussed. In addition to direct and synergistic activities, flavonoids inhibit a number of bacterial virulence factors, including quorum-sensing signal receptors, enzymes and toxins. Evidence of these molecular effects at the cellular level include in vitro inhibition of biofilm formation, inhibition of bacterial attachment to host ligands, and neutralisation of toxicity towards cultured human cells. In vivo evidence of disruption of bacterial pathogenesis includes demonstrated efficacy against Helicobacter pylori infection and S. aureus α-toxin intoxication."

We characterized bacterial diversity within the human gastric mucosa by using a small subunit 16S rDNA clone library approach and analyzed , sequences generated by broad-range bacterial PCR from gastric endoscopic biopsy samples. A diverse community of phylotypes was identified, featuring diversity at this site greater than previously described. The majority of sequences were assigned to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria phyla. Ten percent of the phylotypes were previously uncharacterized, including a Deinococcus-related organism, relatives of which have been found in extreme environments but not reported before in humans. The gastric clone libraries from subjects contained H. pylori rDNA; however, only of these subjects tested positive for H. pylori by conventional laboratory methods. Statistical analysis revealed a large degree of intersubject variability of the gastric ecosystem. The presence of H. pylori did not affect the composition of the gastric community. This gastric bacterial rDNA data set was significantly different from sequence collections of the human mouth and esophagus described in other studies, indicating that the human stomach may be home to a distinct microbial eco-system. The gastric microbiota may play important, as-yet-undiscovered roles in human health and disease."

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate changes in the global prevalence of H pylori infection. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for studies of the prevalence of H pylori infection published from January , through January , . We analyzed data based on United Nations geoscheme regions and individual countries. We used a random effects model to calculate pooled prevalence estimates with % confidence intervals (CIs), weighted by study size. We extrapolated prevalence estimates to obtain the estimated number of individuals with H pylori infection. RESULTS: Among , reports screened, we identified full-text articles on the prevalence of H pylori infection; were included in the final analysis, comprising data from countries. Africa had the highest pooled prevalence of H pylori infection (%; % CI, -), whereas Oceania had the lowest prevalence (%; % CI, -). Among individual countries, the prevalence of H pylori infection varied from as low as % in Switzerland (% CI, -) to % in Nigeria (% CI, -). Based on regional prevalence estimates, there were approximately billion individuals with H pylori infection worldwide in . CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of H pylori infection worldwide, we observed large amounts of variation among regions-more than half the world's population is infected. These data can be used in development of customized strategies for the global eradication."

We also investigated the effect of the IL- polymorphism on IL- production and histologic degree of gastritis in noncancerous gastric mucosa. Although no correlation was found in the analysis of the IL-1B and IL-1RN polymorphisms, IL- - A/A genotype held a higher risk of atrophic gastritis [odds ratio (OR), ; % confidence interval (CI), -] and gastric cancer (OR, ; % CI, -) compared with the T/T genotype.

The A/A and A/T genotypes were significantly associated with higher levels of IL- protein compared with the T/T genotype. Neutrophil infiltration score was significantly higher in the A/A genotype than in the T/T genotype. In conclusion, we showed that the IL- - T > A polymorphism is associated with higher expression of IL- protein, more severe neutrophil infiltration, and increased risk of atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer."

Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data for the United States show a % drop in incidence of SCC between and , with declines greatest in black males, although incidence in this group remains high compared with other groups. Incidence of ACE has increased -fold over the same period, with a nearly -fold increase in white males. Alcohol and smoking are major, established risk factors for SCC. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is consistently associated with increased risk of ACE, whereas infection with Helicobacter pylori may reduce its incidence. Increasing body mass index is also strongly associated with ACE risk while showing no association or an inverse relationship with SCC. Diet affects both types of esophageal cancer, with a higher intake of fruits and vegetables associated with reduced incidence. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are currently the most promising chemoprevention candidates for both cancer types. Lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and exercise, are additional ways in which the incidence of ACE might be reduced."

PPIs are acid-activated prodrugs that convert to sulfenic acids or sulfenamides that react covalently with one or more cysteines accessible from the luminal surface of the ATPase. Because of covalent binding, their inhibitory effects last much longer than their plasma half-life. However, the short half-life of the drug in the blood and the requirement for acid activation impair their efficacy in acid suppression, particularly at night.

METHODS: Cluster-randomized trial in general practices. Initial treatment with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was performed in patients, H. pylori test-and-eradicate in patients, and PPI followed by H. pylori-testing if symptoms improved in patients. Symptoms, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and use of resources were recorded during a -yr follow-up. RESULTS: The prevalence of H. pylori infection was %. We found no difference among the three strategies (p=) in terms of the proportion of days without dyspeptic symptoms. After yr gastrointestinal symptom scores and quality-of-life scores had improved significantly and equally in the three groups (p<), but no statistically significant differences were found among the groups. The mean use of endoscopies per patient after yr was higher in the PPI group ( [% CI -]) than in the test-and-eradicate group ( [% CI -]) and the combination group ( [% CI -]), p=. H. pylori-positive patients given eradication therapy had more days without dyspeptic symptoms (p<), used less antisecretory therapy (p<), and were more satisfied (p<) than H. pylori-negative patients. CONCLUSION: The strategies based on H. pylori test enjoyed similar symptom resolution, but reduced endoscopic workload and lower -yr total costs compared with empirical antisecretory therapy."

However, a significant gap remains in moving nano/micromotors from test tubes to living organisms for treating diseases with high efficacy. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, in vivo therapeutic micromotors application for active drug delivery to treat gastric bacterial infection in a mouse model using clarithromycin as a model antibiotic and Helicobacter pylori infection as a model disease. The propulsion of drug-loaded magnesium micromotors in gastric media enables effective antibiotic delivery, leading to significant bacteria burden reduction in the mouse stomach compared with passive drug carriers, with no apparent toxicity. Moreover, while the drug-loaded micromotors reach similar therapeutic efficacy as the positive control of free drug plus proton pump inhibitor, the micromotors can function without proton pump inhibitors because of their built-in proton depletion function associated with their locomotion.Nano- and micromotors have been demonstrated in vitro for a range of applications.

Due to its large public health and societal implications, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis has been long regarded by WHO as a global priority for investment in new drugs. In , WHO was requested by member states to create a priority list of other antibiotic-resistant bacteria to support research and development of effective drugs. METHODS: We used a multicriteria decision analysis method to prioritise antibiotic-resistant bacteria; this method involved the identification of relevant criteria to assess priority against which each antibiotic-resistant bacterium was rated. The final priority ranking of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria was established after a preference-based survey was used to obtain expert weighting of criteria. FINDINGS: We selected bacterial species with patterns of acquired resistance and ten criteria to assess priority: mortality, health-care burden, community burden, prevalence of resistance, -year trend of resistance, transmissibility, preventability in the community setting, preventability in the health-care setting, treatability, and pipeline. We stratified the priority list into three tiers (critical, high, and medium priority), using the 33rd percentile of the bacterium's total scores as the cutoff. Critical-priority bacteria included carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and carbapenem-resistant and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The highest ranked Gram-positive bacteria (high priority) were vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Of the bacteria typically responsible for community-acquired infections, clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori, and fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter spp, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella typhi were included in the high-priority tier. INTERPRETATION: Future development strategies should focus on antibiotics that are active against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and Gram-negative bacteria. The global strategy should include antibiotic-resistant bacteria responsible for community-acquired infections such as Salmonella spp, Campylobacter spp, N gonorrhoeae, and H pylori.

Two studies have demonstrated early childhood as the period of transmission of infection and identified an infected sibling as an important risk factor. An oral-oral route of spread has been substantiated with several studies showing the presence of H. pylori in the oral cavity. Studies have shown the presence of H. pylori in drinking water and the role of poor living conditions and sanitation in H. pylori infection, supporting an oral-fecal route of spread. Screening for H. pylori as a gastric cancer pre-screening strategy has been described in Japan, and the importance of H. pylori eradication as a gastric cancer-prevention strategy has now been further emphasized in Japanese guidelines.

Although Helicobacter pylori infection is the main risk factor, in about % or more of gastric cancers, the molecular pathway underlying H. pylori infection leading to the development of gastric cancers remains unclear. Recently accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) may regulate diverse biological processes and may be important in tumorigenesis. miR- has been frequently observed to be aberrantly overexpressed in various tumors. Using TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR, we confirmed that miR- was significantly overexpressed in human gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Remarkably, miR- was also significantly overexpressed in H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa, implying that overexpression of miR- in gastric cancer may be due in part to H. pylori infection. More importantly, we showed that forced expression of miR- significantly enhanced cell proliferation and invasion in AGS cells, a human gastric cancer cell line, whereas knockdown of miR- by inhibitor caused a significant reduction in cell proliferation and a significant increase in apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that knockdown of miR- significantly decreased cell invasion and migration of AGS cells. Finally, we showed that RECK, a known tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, is a bona fide target of miR-. Taken together, miR- may be important in the initiation and progression of gastric cancers as an oncomiR, likely through regulating RECK. Our findings suggest a potential regulatory pathway in which H. pylori infection upregulates expression of miR-, which in turn downregulates RECK, and then leads to the development of gastric cancer."

Although aberrant DNA methylation is deeply involved in gastric carcinogenesis, its induction by Helicobacter pylori, a strong gastric carcinogen, is unclear. Here, we analyzed the effect of H. pylori infection on the quantity of methylated DNA molecules in noncancerous gastric mucosae and examined its association with gastric cancer risk. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gastric mucosae were collected from healthy volunteers ( H. pylori negative and H. pylori positive) and cases with differentiated-type gastric cancers ( H. pylori negative and H. pylori positive) by endoscopy. The numbers of DNA molecules methylated and unmethylated for eight regions of seven CpG islands (CGI) were quantified by quantitative PCR after bisulfite modification, and fractions of methylated molecules (methylation levels) were calculated. RESULTS: Among healthy volunteers, methylation levels of all the eight regions were - to -fold higher in H. pylori positives than in H. pylori negatives (P < ). Methylation levels of the LOX, HAND1, and THBD promoter CGIs and p41ARC exonic CGI were as high as % or more in H. pylori-positive individuals. Among H. pylori-negative individuals, methylation levels of all the eight regions were - to -fold higher in gastric cancer cases than in age-matched healthy volunteers (P < or = ). Among H. pylori-positive individuals, methylation levels were highly variable, and that of only HAND1 was significantly increased in gastric cancer cases (-fold, P = ). CONCLUSIONS: It was indicated that H. pylori infection potently induces methylation of CGIs to various degrees. Methylation levels of specific CGIs seemed to reflect gastric cancer risk in H. pylori-negative individuals."

Gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from colonic cancer or gastric cancer, and malabsorption in coeliac disease are the most important causes that need to be sought. DEFINING IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA: The lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test should be used to define anaemia (B). Any level of anaemia should be investigated in the presence of iron deficiency (B). The lower the haemoglobin the more likely there is to be serious underlying pathology and the more urgent is the need for investigation (B). Red cell indices provide a sensitive indication of iron deficiency in the absence of chronic disease or haemoglobinopathy (A). Haemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis and hypochromia are present in patients of appropriate ethnic background to prevent unnecessary GI investigation (C). Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deficiency (A). INVESTIGATIONS: Upper and lower GI investigations should be considered in all postmenopausal female and all male patients where IDA has been confirmed unless there is a history of significant overt non-GI blood loss (A). All patients should be screened for coeliac disease (B). If oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed as the initial GI investigation, only the presence of advanced gastric cancer or coeliac disease should deter lower GI investigation (B). In patients aged > or with marked anaemia or a significant family history of colorectal carcinoma, lower GI investigation should still be considered even if coeliac disease is found (B). Colonoscopy has advantages over CT colography for investigation of the lower GI tract in IDA, but either is acceptable (B). Either is preferable to barium enema, which is useful if they are not available. Further direct visualisation of the small bowel is not necessary unless there are symptoms suggestive of small bowel disease, or if the haemoglobin cannot be restored or maintained with iron therapy (B). In patients with recurrent IDA and normal OGD and colonoscopy results, Helicobacter pylori should be eradicated if present. (C). Faecal occult blood testing is of no benefit in the investigation of IDA (B). All premenopausal women with IDA should be screened for coeliac disease, but other upper and lower GI investigation should be reserved for those aged years or older, those with symptoms suggesting gastrointestinal disease, and those with a strong family history of colorectal cancer (B). Upper and lower GI investigation of IDA in post-gastrectomy patients is recommended in those over years of age (B). In patients with iron deficiency without anaemia, endoscopic investigation rarely detects malignancy. Such investigation should be considered in patients aged > after discussing the risk and potential benefit with them (C). Only postmenopausal women and men aged > years should have GI investigation of iron deficiency without anaemia (C). Rectal examination is seldom contributory, and, in the absence of symptoms such as rectal bleeding and tenesmus, may be postponed until colonoscopy. Urine testing for blood is important in the examination of patients with IDA (B). MANAGEMENT: All patients should have iron supplementation both to correct anaemia and replenish body stores (B). Parenteral iron can be used when oral preparations are not tolerated (C). Blood transfusions should be reserved for patients with or at risk of cardiovascular instability due to the degree of their anaemia (C)."

Most bacteria are haploid for the vast majority of their genes and, coupled with typically short generation times, this allows mutations to emerge and accumulate rapidly, and to effect significant phenotypic changes in what is perceived to be real-time. Not least among these phenotypic changes are those associated with antibiotic resistance. Mechanisms of horizontal gene spread among bacterial strains or species are often considered to be the main mediators of antibiotic resistance. However, mutational resistance has been invaluable in studies of bacterial genetics, and also has primary clinical importance in certain bacterial species, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori, or when considering resistance to particular antibiotics, especially to synthetic agents such as fluoroquinolones and oxazolidinones. In addition, mutation is essential for the continued evolution of acquired resistance genes and has, e.g., given rise to over variants of the TEM family of beta-lactamases. Hypermutator strains of bacteria, which have mutations in genes affecting DNA repair and replication fidelity, have elevated mutation rates. Mutational resistance emerges de novo more readily in these hypermutable strains, and they also provide a suitable host background for the evolution of acquired resistance genes in vitro. In the clinical setting, hypermutator strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, but a more general role for hypermutators in the emergence of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in a wider variety of bacterial pathogens has not yet been proven."

To establish the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in gastric mucosa by endoscopic features, a prospective multicenter study was carried out. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-seven registered patients from facilities between March and February were enrolled. Association between endoscopic findings (conventional findings and indigocarmine contrast (IC) method findings) and diagnosis of H. pylori infection made by microscopic observation of biopsy specimens was investigated in the corpus and antrum and their diagnostic accuracies were investigated. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-five patients were analyzed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for H. pylori infection of conventional endoscopy was in thecorpus and in the antrum (P = ). Evaluation of diffuse redness, spotty redness and mucosal swelling by conventional endoscopy and swelling of areae gastricae by the indigocarmine contrast (IC) method were useful for diagnosing H. pylori infection. Regular arrangement of collecting venules (RAC) in the angle, fundic gland polyposis, hemorrhagic erosion and bleeding spot in the corpus and red streaks, and erosions (flat, raised, hemorrhagic and bleeding spot) in the antrum may be used as diagnostic features suggesting negative H. pylori infection. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that endoscopic diagnosis of H. pylori infection in gastric mucosa by conventional endoscopy and the IC method is mostly possible."

Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), Helicobacter pylori infection, gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomotic leaks, postoperative bleeding, operative time, type of suture material, and marginal ulcer formation were collected. Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analysis of discrete variables, and Student's t-test was used for continuous variables. Statistical significance was set at an alpha of . RESULTS: The overall marginal ulceration rate was %. Demographic data (age, gender distribution, BMI) did not differ significantly between patients who experienced marginal ulceration and those who did not (p > ). Similarly, technical factors (choice of permanent or absorbable suture for the GJ anastomosis, attending as primary surgeon, robotic GJ, operative time, postoperative hematocrit drop) were not statistically different between the two groups (p > ). Finally, the prevalence of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, musculoskeletal complaints, dyslipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD] and peptic ulcer disease [PUD]) did not differ significantly between the two groups (p > ). However, preoperative H. pylori infection, although adequately treated, was twice as common among the patients who had marginal ulceration (%) as among those who did not (%) (p = ). All the patients who experienced marginal ulcers had complete resolution of symptoms with proton pump inhibitors and sucralfate. No reoperations were required for marginal ulceration. CONCLUSION: Helicobacter pylori may potentiate marginal ulcer formation. The authors hypothesize that H. pylori damages the mucosal barrier in a way that persists postoperatively, which may precipitate marginal ulceration even when the organism has been medically eradicated."

Inflammation-related cancers are characterized by mutagenic DNA lesions, such as -oxo-,-dihydro-'-deoxyguanosine (-oxodG) and -nitroguanine. Our previous studies demonstrated the formation of -oxodG and -nitroguanine in the tissues of cancer and precancerous lesions due to infection (e.g., Opisthorchis viverrini-related cholangiocarcinoma, Schistosoma haematobium-associated bladder cancer, Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric cancer, human papillomavirus-related cervical cancer, Epstein-Barr virus-infected nasopharyngeal carcinoma) and pro-inflammatory factors (e.g., asbestos, nanomaterials, and inflammatory diseases such as Barrett's esophagus and oral leukoplakia). Interestingly, several of our studies suggested that inflammation-associated DNA damage in cancer stem-like cells leads to cancer development with aggressive clinical features. Reactive oxygen/nitrogen species from inflammation damage not only DNA but also other biomacromolecules, such as proteins and lipids, resulting in their dysfunction. We identified oxidatively damaged proteins in cancer tissues by 2D Oxyblot followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF. As an example, oxidatively damaged transferrin released iron ion, which may mediate Fenton reactions and generate additional reactive oxygen species. Dysfunction of anti-oxidative proteins due to this damage might increase oxidative stress. Such damage in biomacromolecules may form a vicious cycle of oxidative stress, leading to cancer development. Epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation and microRNA dysregulation play vital roles in carcinogenesis, especially in inflammation-related cancers. We examined epigenetic alterations, DNA methylation and microRNA dysregulation, in Epstein-Barr virus-related nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the endemic area of Southern China and found several differentially methylated tumor suppressor gene candidates by using a next-generation sequencer. Among these candidates, we revealed higher methylation rates of RAS-like estrogen-regulated growth inhibitor (RERG) in biopsy specimens of nasopharyngeal carcinoma more conveniently by using restriction enzyme-based real-time PCR. This result may help to improve cancer screening strategies. We profiled microRNAs of nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues using microarrays. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed the concordant downregulation of miR- in cancer tissues and plasma, suggesting that plasma miR- could be used as a diagnostic biomarker for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

To provide evidence-based guidance, we performed a systematic review of the literature published in English, selecting articles reporting or more total patients. We identified studies including patients, of whom were evaluable for the effects of H pylori eradication on platelet count. The weighted mean complete response (platelet count > or = x ()/L) and overall response (platelet count > or = x ()/L and at least doubling of the basal count) were % (% confidence interval [CI], %-%) and % (% CI, %-%), respectively. In patients with a baseline platelet count less than x ()/L, the complete response rate was % (% CI, %-%) and the overall response rate was % (% CI, %-%). The response rate tended to be higher in countries with a high background prevalence of H pylori infection and in patients with milder degrees of thrombocytopenia. These findings suggest that the detection and eradication of H pylori infection should be considered in the work-up of patients with seemingly typical ITP."

Although chronic infections have been associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and cardiovascular disease, there is limited evidence on how infections affect risk of diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the association between serological evidence of chronic viral and bacterial infections and incident diabetes in a prospective cohort of Latino elderly. We analyzed data on individuals aged > years and diabetes-free in -, whose blood was tested for antibodies to herpes simplex virus , varicella virus, cytomegalovirus, Helicobacter pylori, and Toxoplasma gondii and who were followed until June . We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the relative incidence rate of diabetes by serostatus, with adjustment for age, sex, education, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and cholesterol levels. RESULTS: Individuals seropositive for herpes simplex virus , varicella virus, cytomegalovirus, and T. gondii did not show an increased rate of diabetes, whereas those who were seropositive for H. pylori at enrollment were times more likely at any given time to develop diabetes than seronegative individuals (hazard ratio [% CI -]). Controlling for insulin resistance, C-reactive protein and interleukin- did not attenuate the effect of H. pylori infection. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated for the first time that H. pylori infection leads to an increased rate of incident diabetes in a prospective cohort study. Our findings implicate a potential role for antibiotic and gastrointestinal treatment in preventing diabetes."

Our aim was to investigate the prophylactic effect of H pylori eradication on the development of metachronous gastric carcinoma after endoscopic resection for early gastric cancer. METHODS: In this multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial, patients with early gastric cancer, either newly diagnosed and planning to have endoscopic treatment or in post-resection follow-up after endoscopic treatment, were randomly assigned to receive an H pylori eradication regimen (n=) or control (n=). Randomisation was done by a computer-generated randomisation list and was stratified by whether the patient was newly diagnosed or post-resection. Patients in the eradication group received lansoprazole mg twice daily, amoxicillin mg twice daily, and clarithromycin mg twice daily for a week; those in the control group received standard care, but no treatment for H pylori. Patients were examined endoscopically at , , , and months after allocation. The primary endpoint was diagnosis of new carcinoma at another site in the stomach. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number UMIN000001169. FINDINGS: At -year follow-up, metachronous gastric carcinoma had developed in nine patients in the eradication group and in the control group. In the full intention-to-treat population, including all patients irrespective of length of follow-up ( patients in each group), the odds ratio for metachronous gastric carcinoma was (% CI -; p=); in the modified intention-to-treat population, including patients with at least one post-randomisation assessment of tumour status and adjusting for loss to follow-up ( patients in the eradication group, in the control group), the hazard ratio for metachronous gastric carcinoma was (% CI -; p=). In the eradication group, (%) patients had diarrhoea and (%) had soft stools. INTERPRETATION: Prophylactic eradication of H pylori after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer should be used to prevent the development of metachronous gastric carcinoma.

Data from several case-control studies and one large study using case series methodology indicate that recent infection is a temporarily acting, independent trigger factor for ischemic stroke. Both bacterial and viral infections, particularly respiratory tract infections, contribute to this association. A causal role for infection in stroke is supported by a graded temporal relationship between these conditions, and by multiple pathophysiological pathways linking infection and inflammation, thrombosis, and stroke. Furthermore, observational studies suggest that influenza vaccination confers a preventive effect against stroke. Case-control and prospective studies indicate that chronic infections, such as periodontitis, chronic bronchitis and infection with Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae or Cytomegalovirus, might increase stroke risk, although considerable variation exists in the results of these studies, and methodological issues regarding serological results remain unresolved. Increasing evidence indicates that the aggregate burden of chronic and/or past infections rather than any one single infectious disease is associated with the risk of stroke. Furthermore, genetic predispositions relating to infection susceptibility and the strength of the inflammatory response seem to co-determine this risk. Here, we summarize and analyze the evidence for common acute and chronic infectious diseases as stroke risk factors."

The surveillance of pathogens in primates plays an important role in anticipating possible outbreaks. In this study, we conducted a molecular investigation of pathogenic bacteria in feces from African nonhuman primates (NHPs). We also investigated the pathogens shared by the human population and gorillas living in the same territory in the Republic of Congo. In total, % of NHPs (n=) and % (n=) of humans were found to carry at least one bacterium. Non-pallidum Treponema spp. (including T. succinifaciens, T. berlinense, and several potential new species) were recovered from stools of % of great apes, % of monkeys, and % of humans. Non-tuberculosis Mycobacterium spp. were also common in almost all NHP species as well as in humans. In addition, Acinetobacter spp., members of the primate gut microbiota, were mainly prevalent in human and gorilla. Pathogenic Leptospira spp. were highly present in humans (%) and gorillas (%) stool samples in Congo, but were absent in the other NHPs, therefore suggesting a possible gorillas-humans exchange. Particular attention will be necessary for enteropathogenic bacteria detected in humans such as Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella spp. (including S. typhi/paratyphi), Staphyloccocus aureus, and Tropheryma whipplei, some of which were also present in gorillas in the same territory (S. aureus and T. whipplei). This study enhances our knowledge of pathogenic bacteria that threaten African NHPs and humans by using a non-invasive sampling technique. Contact between humans and NHPs results in an exchange of pathogens. Ongoing surveillance, prevention, and treatment strategies alone will limit the spread of these infectious agents."

Even though GroEL proteins are classically considered intracellular proteins, they have been found at the surface of several mucosal pathogens and have been implicated in cell attachment and immune modulation. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the GroEL protein of a gram-positive probiotic bacterium, Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 (NCC ). Its presence at the bacterial surface was demonstrated using a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and could be detected in bacterial spent culture medium by immunoblotting. To assess binding of La1 GroEL to mucins and intestinal epithelial cells, the La1 GroEL protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. We report here that La1 recombinant GroEL (rGroEL) binds to mucins and epithelial cells and that this binding is pH dependent. Immunomodulation studies showed that La1 rGroEL stimulates interleukin- secretion in macrophages and HT29 cells in a CD14-dependent mechanism. This property is common to rGroEL from other gram-positive bacteria but not to the rGroEL of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. In addition, La1 rGroEL mediates the aggregation of H. pylori but not that of other intestinal pathogens. Our in vitro results suggest that GroEL proteins from La1 and other lactic acid bacteria might play a role in gastrointestinal homeostasis due to their ability to bind to components of the gastrointestinal mucosa and to aggregate H. pylori."

We included cross-sectional studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of UBT in adult patients with dyspeptic symptoms. Risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies)- tool. Diagnostic accuracy measures were pooled using the random-effects model. Subgroup analysis was conducted by UBT type (13C vs 14C) and by measurement technique (Infrared spectrometry vs Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry).

The incidence is particularly high in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and parts of Central and South America, and it is about twice as high among men than among women. Prognosis is generally rather poor, with -year relative survival below % in most countries. The best established risk factors for stomach cancer are Helicobacter pylori infection, the by far strongest established risk factor for distal stomach cancer, and male sex, a family history of stomach cancer, and smoking. While some factors related to diet and food preservation, such as high intake of salt-preserved foods and dietary nitrite or low intake of fruit and vegetables, are likely to increase the risk of stomach cancer, the quantitative impact of many dietary factors remains uncertain, partly due to limitations of exposure assessment and control for confounding factors. Future epidemiologic research should pay particular attention to differentiation of stomach cancer epidemiology by subsite, and to exploration of potential interactions between H. pylori infection, genetic, and environmental factors."

We aimed to assess the real-time diagnostic validity of high resolution endoscopy with and without NBI in the diagnosis of gastric premalignant conditions and to derive a classification for endoscopic grading of gastric intestinal metaplasia (EGGIM). METHODS: A multicenter prospective study (five centers: Portugal, Italy, Romania, UK, USA) was performed involving the systematic use of high resolution gastroscopes with image registry with and without NBI in a centralized informatics platform (available online). All users used the same NBI classification. Histologic result was considered the diagnostic gold standard. RESULTS: A total of patients and endoscopic biopsies were included. NBI globally increased diagnostic accuracy by percentage points (NBI % vs. WLE %; P < ) with no difference in the identification of Helicobacter pylori gastritis ( % vs. %). NBI increased sensitivity for the diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia significantly ( % vs. %; P < ) and for the diagnosis of dysplasia ( % vs. %). The added benefit of NBI in terms of diagnostic accuracy was greater in OLGIM III/IV than in OLGIM I/II ( percentage points vs. percentage points, respectively; P < ). The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for EGGIM in the identification of extensive metaplasia was . CONCLUSIONS: In a real-time scenario, NBI demonstrates a high concordance with gastric histology, superior to WLE. Diagnostic accuracy higher than % suggests that routine use of NBI allows targeted instead of random biopsy samples. EGGIM also permits immediate grading of intestinal metaplasia without biopsies and merits further investigation."

Thus, metallation of an estimated % of metalloenzymes is aided by metal delivery systems, with ∼ % acquiring preassembled metal cofactors. The remaining ∼ % are presumed to compete for metals from buffered metal pools. Metallation is further aided by maintaining the relative concentrations of these pools as an inverse function of the stabilities of the respective metal complexes. For example, magnesium enzymes always prefer to bind zinc, and these metals dominate the metalloenzymes without metal delivery systems. Therefore, the buffered concentration of zinc is held at least a million-fold below magnesium inside most cells."

This in turn permits intimate biotransfer of graphene nanosensors onto biomaterials, including tooth enamel. The result is a fully biointerfaced sensing platform, which can be tuned to detect target analytes. For example, via self-assembly of antimicrobial peptides onto graphene, we show bioselective detection of bacteria at single-cell levels. Incorporation of a resonant coil eliminates the need for onboard power and external connections. Combining these elements yields two-tiered interfacing of peptide-graphene nanosensors with biomaterials. In particular, we demonstrate integration onto a tooth for remote monitoring of respiration and bacteria detection in saliva. Overall, this strategy of interfacing graphene nanosensors with biomaterials represents a versatile approach for ubiquitous detection of biochemical targets."

The Kyoto classification organized endoscopic findings related to H. pylori infection. The Kyoto classification score is the sum of scores for five endoscopic findings (atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, enlarged folds, nodularity, and diffuse redness with or without regular arrangement of collecting venules) and ranges from to . Atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, enlarged folds, and nodularity contribute to gastric cancer risk. Diffuse redness and regular arrangement of collecting venules are related to H. pylori infection status. In subjects without a history of H. pylori eradication, the infection rates in those with Kyoto scores of , , and ≥ were %, %, and %, respectively. A Kyoto classification score of indicates no H. pylori infection. A Kyoto classification score of or more indicates H. pylori infection. Kyoto classification scores of patients with and without gastric cancer were and , respectively. A Kyoto classification score of or more might indicate gastric cancer risk."

The Trx system provides the electrons to thiol-dependent peroxidases (peroxiredoxins) to remove reactive oxygen and nitrogen species with a fast reaction rate. Trx antioxidant functions are also shown by involvement in DNA and protein repair by reducing ribonucleotide reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductases, and regulating the activity of many redox-sensitive transcription factors. Moreover, Trx systems play critical roles in the immune response, virus infection, and cell death via interaction with thioredoxin-interacting protein. In mammalian cells, the cytosolic and mitochondrial Trx systems, in which TrxRs are high molecular weight selenoenzymes, together with the glutathione-glutaredoxin (Grx) system (NADPH, glutathione reductase, GSH, and Grx) control the cellular redox environment. Recently mammalian thioredoxin and glutathione systems have been found to be able to provide the electrons crossly and to serve as a backup system for each other. In contrast, bacteria TrxRs are low molecular weight enzymes with a structure and reaction mechanism distinct from mammalian TrxR. Many bacterial species possess specific thiol-dependent antioxidant systems, and the significance of the Trx system in the defense against oxidative stress is different. Particularly, the absence of a GSH-Grx system in some pathogenic bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Staphylococcus aureus makes the bacterial Trx system essential for survival under oxidative stress. This provides an opportunity to kill these bacteria by targeting the TrxR-Trx system."

METHODS: A total of , esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedures from private practices in states in the Caris Diagnostics database from April to March were searched for the endoscopic designations of polyp, nodule, and mass, and for the pathological diagnoses that commonly present as gastric polyps. Pertinent demographic data, clinical indications for EGD, and information regarding Helicobacter pylori infection, reactive gastropathy, chronic inactive gastritis, and intestinal metaplasia were also obtained. RESULTS: A total of , of the , patients who underwent EGD had gastric biopsies. The prevalence of gastric polyps in the EGD population was %; % were fundic gland polyps, % hyperplastic polyps/polypoid foveolar hyperplasia, % adenomas, and % inflammatory fibroid polyps. Malignant neoplasms were slightly >%. None of the benign gastric polyps had a significant positive association with concurrent H. pylori infection; intestinal metaplasia was detected in the background of % of carcinoids, % of adenomas, % of xanthomas, and % of adenocarcinomas and hyperplastic polyps. Adenomas were rarely associated with synchronous adenocarcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: The relative prevalence of fundic gland polyps in this population was much higher than that reported earlier, most likely because of the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors. H. pylori- and atrophy-associated polyps, including adenomas, were less common than in earlier series."

METHODS: We reviewed clinical documentation and samples from separate GI biopsy or resection sites on CVID patients obtained over a -year period, including biopsies from the colon (), esophagus (), small intestine (), and stomach (), a partial gastrectomy, small bowel resection, colectomy, cholecystectomies, and appendectomy. RESULTS: There were males and females. Nine patients were children ( y and younger) and were adults. Age at diagnosis ranged from months to years (median, y), and age at biopsy ranged from months to years (median, y). Esophageal samples often showed intraepithelial neutrophils, accompanied by candida. Half of patients' esophageal biopsies had prominent intraepithelial lymphocytosis, one of which also had prominent apoptosis. The stomachs of % of patients lacked plasma cells. Most showed lymphoid aggregates. An increase in apoptosis was detected in biopsies from a third. About % had a lymphocytic gastritis pattern. Intraepithelial neutrophils were found in a subset, accompanied by various infections [cytomegalovirus (CMV), Helicobacter pylori, and Cryptosporidium]. Granulomas were found in patient. Gastric adenocarcinoma was identified in one patient. There was a paucity of small bowel plasma cells in the majority of patients (%). The small bowel showed prominent lymphoid aggregates in about half (%). An increase in apoptosis was detected in specimens from about %. Increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were found in samples from over half of patients (%), most of whom (%) also had villous blunting, mimicking celiac disease. Intraepithelial neutrophils were found in a subset (%) and correlated with CMV and Cryptosporidium infections. Granulomas were seen in biopsies from patients (%). One patient had a collagenous enteritis pattern (accompanied by a collagenous colitis pattern). One patient had autoimmune enteritis; biopsies from this patient were initially relatively normal but later displayed prominent crypt apoptosis and loss of goblet cells. In colon samples, a paucity of plasma cells was seen in patients (%). The colon showed lymphoid aggregates in most patients (%). Apoptosis was prominent in samples from half of the patients (%). Biopsies from patients had a lymphocytic colitis pattern (%) and patients had a collagenous colitis pattern. Intraepithelial neutrophils were found in samples from most patients (%). Crypt distortion was seen in of these patients (%), thereby mimicking ulcerative or Crohn colitis. Granulomas were found in patients (%). CMV was detected in patient. The appendix from patient showed Cryptosporidium and acute serositis with a paucity of plasma cells and an increase in apoptosis. The gallbladder from patient showed acute cholecystitis, and another patient's gallbladder lacked plasma cells. CONCLUSIONS: GI tract CVID displays a wide spectrum of histologic patterns. Its features can mimic lymphocytic colitis, collagenous enterocolitis, celiac disease, lymphocytic gastritis, granulomatous disease, acute graft-versus-host disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. In fact, in our series, we found patients with a prior diagnosis of celiac disease (%) and inflammatory bowel disease (%), including Crohn disease (%). The diagnosis of CVID may be suspected on the basis of the lack of plasma cells in a GI biopsy, but because this feature is only present in about two-thirds of patients, the diagnosis cannot always be suggested in isolation of other clinical and laboratory findings."

This underscores the importance of diagnosis and risk stratification for these patients. High definition endoscopy with chromoendoscopy (CE) is better than high definition white-light endoscopy alone for this purpose. Virtual CE can guide biopsies for staging atrophic and metaplastic changes and can target neoplastic lesions. Biopsies should be taken from at least two topographic sites (antrum and corpus) and labelled in two separate vials. For patients with mild to moderate atrophy restricted to the antrum there is no evidence to recommend surveillance. In patients with IM at a single location but with a family history of gastric cancer, incomplete IM, or persistent Helicobacter pylori gastritis, endoscopic surveillance with CE and guided biopsies may be considered in years. Patients with advanced stages of atrophic gastritis should be followed up with a high quality endoscopy every years. In patients with dysplasia, in the absence of an endoscopically defined lesion, immediate high quality endoscopic reassessment with CE is recommended. Patients with an endoscopically visible lesion harboring low or high grade dysplasia or carcinoma should undergo staging and treatment. H. pylori eradication heals nonatrophic chronic gastritis, may lead to regression of atrophic gastritis, and reduces the risk of gastric cancer in patients with these conditions, and it is recommended. H. pylori eradication is also recommended for patients with neoplasia after endoscopic therapy. In intermediate to high risk regions, identification and surveillance of patients with precancerous gastric conditions is cost-effective."

The cagA-encoded CagA protein is delivered into gastric epithelial cells via the bacterial type IV secretion system and, upon tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases, specifically binds to and aberrantly activates SHP- tyrosine phosphatase, a bona fide oncoprotein in human malignancies. CagA also elicits junctional and polarity defects in epithelial cells by interacting with and inhibiting partitioning-defective (PAR1)/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK) independently of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation. Despite these CagA activities that contribute to neoplastic transformation, a causal link between CagA and in vivo oncogenesis remains unknown. Here, we generated transgenic mice expressing wild-type or phosphorylation-resistant CagA throughout the body or predominantly in the stomach. Wild-type CagA transgenic mice showed gastric epithelial hyperplasia and some of the mice developed gastric polyps and adenocarcinomas of the stomach and small intestine. Systemic expression of wild-type CagA further induced leukocytosis with IL-/GM-CSF hypersensitivity and some mice developed myeloid leukemias and B cell lymphomas, the hematological malignancies also caused by gain-of-function SHP- mutations. Such pathological abnormalities were not observed in transgenic mice expressing phosphorylation-resistant CagA. These results provide first direct evidence for the role of CagA as a bacterium-derived oncoprotein (bacterial oncoprotein) that acts in mammals and further indicate the importance of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation, which enables CagA to deregulate SHP-, in the development of H. pylori-associated neoplasms."

DATA EXTRACTION: independently done by two reviewers. DATA SYNTHESIS: meta-analyses combining the sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios (LRs) of the individual studies. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies, including , patients, evaluated the monoclonal SAT before eradication therapy. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, LR+, and LR- were: (% CI -), (-), (-), and (-). The accuracy of both monoclonal and polyclonal SAT was evaluated together in pretreatment studies, and higher pooled sensitivity was demonstrated with the monoclonal technique ( vs ). Twelve studies, including patients, assessed the monoclonal SAT to confirm eradication after therapy. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, LR+, and LR- were (-), (-), (-), and (-). Both tests were evaluated together in eight post-treatment studies and, again, the monoclonal technique showed higher sensitivity ( vs ). Heterogeneity among studies disappeared when a single outlier study was excluded. Subanalysis depending on the reference method, the study population, or the study quality showed similar results. CONCLUSION: Monoclonal SAT is an accurate noninvasive method both for the initial diagnosis of H. pylori infection and for the confirmation of its eradication after treatment. The monoclonal technique has higher sensitivity than the polyclonal one, especially in the post-treatment setting."

H. pylori strains that express the vacuolating cytotoxin or the outer membrane protein OipA are similarly associated with severe pathologic outcomes. We previously reported that an in vivo adapted H. pylori strain, , induces gastric adenocarcinoma in rodent models of gastritis. In the current study, we used carcinogenic strain as a prototype to define the role of virulence constituents in H. pylori-mediated carcinogenesis. Mongolian gerbils were infected with wild-type strain or cagA(-), vacA(-), or oipA(-) mutants for to weeks. All infected gerbils developed gastritis; however, inflammation was significantly attenuated in animals infected with the cagA(-) but not the vacA(-) or oipA(-) strains. Gastric dysplasia and cancer developed in >% of gerbils infected with either the wild-type or vacA(-) strain but in none of the animals infected with the cagA(-) strain. Inactivation of oipA decreased beta-catenin nuclear localization in vitro and reduced the incidence of cancer in gerbils. OipA expression was detected significantly more frequently among H. pylori strains isolated from human subjects with gastric cancer precursor lesions versus persons with gastritis alone. These results indicate that loss of CagA prevents the development of cancer in this model. Inactivation of oipA attenuates beta-catenin nuclear translocation and also decreases the incidence of carcinoma. In addition to defining factors that mediate H. pylori-induced cancer, these results provide insight into mechanisms that may regulate the development of other malignancies arising within the context of inflammatory states."

Our aim was to study the association between H. pylori-positive gastritis and the occurrence of any colonic neoplasm. METHODS: From a computerized database of surgical pathology reports, we selected , subjects who underwent colonoscopy and esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy with biopsy results from both procedures. RESULTS: Compared with normal gastric mucosa, H. pylori gastritis occurred more frequently among patients with hyperplastic polyps (OR=, % CI: -), adenomatous polyps (, -), advanced adenomas (, -), villous adenomas or adenomas with high-grade dysplasia (, -), and adenocarcinomas (, -). Similarly, the strength of the association between H. pylori-positive gastritis and colonic neoplasm increased with size and number of the adenomas. The association between H. pylori gastritis and the occurrence of colonic neoplasm was similar for different locations of the large bowel. Other gastric conditions etiologically associated with H. pylori, such as intestinal metaplasia, adenoma, lymphoma, and adenocarcinoma, were also significantly associated with an increased risk of colonic neoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: Various forms of gastritis related to H. pylori infection confer an increased risk for colonic neoplasm. In the past, when H. pylori infection was more prevalent, its attributable risk to the occurrence of colorectal neoplasm may have been quite substantial."

Mutations in hns are lethal in Salmonella unless accompanied by compensatory mutations in other regulatory loci. Thus, H-NS provides a previously unrecognized mechanism of bacterial defense against foreign DNA, enabling the acquisition of DNA from exogenous sources while avoiding detrimental consequences from unregulated expression of newly acquired genes.

To mediate chemotaxis, C. jejuni and H. pylori combine basic chemotaxis signal transduction components with several accessory proteins. H. pylori is unusual in that it lacks a methylation-based adaptation system and produces multiple CheV coupling proteins.

OBJECTIVE: To identify prevalent and incident diseases in patients with AA and quantify their prevalence and odds and hazard ratios compared with those in controls without AA. METHODS: A systematic review of the studies published before February , , was performed by using the MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Observational studies on prevalent or incident diseases in patients with AA were included, whereas studies limited to pediatrics or providing only laboratory results or continuous data were excluded. The inverse variance method with a random-effects model was used for meta-analyses. RESULTS: A total of studies were analyzed. Atopic diseases, metabolic syndrome, Helicobacter pylori infection, lupus erythematosus, iron deficiency anemia, thyroid diseases, psychiatric diseases, vitamin D deficiency, and audiologic and ophthalmic abnormalities were more prevalent in patients with AA. Patients with AA had a higher risk of developing autoimmune diseases. LIMITATIONS: Some diseases were investigated by an insufficient number of studies to be meta-analyzed. Meta-analysis of incident diseases was not performed owing to the limited availability of cohort studies. CONCLUSION: AA is associated with various systemic and psychiatric diseases.

To date, several researches have shown that migraine is associated with some gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and celiac disease (CD). The present review article aims to discuss the direct and indirect evidence suggesting relationships between migraine and the gut-brain axis. However, the mechanisms explaining how the gut and the brain may interact in patients with migraine are not entirely clear. Studies suggest that this interaction seems to be influenced by multiple factors such as inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-, IL-, and TNF-α), gut microbiota profile, neuropeptides and serotonin pathway, stress hormones and nutritional substances. Neuropeptides including CGRP, SP, VIP, NPY are thought to have antimicrobial impact on a variety of the gut bacterial strains and thus speculated to be involved in the bidirectional relationship between the gut and the brain. According to the current knowledge, migraine headache in patients harboring HP might be improved following the bacteria eradication. Migraineurs with long headache history and high headache frequency have a higher chance of being diagnosed with IBS. IBS and migraine share some similarities and can alter gut microflora composition and thereby may affect the gut-brain axis and inflammatory status. Migraine has been also associated with CD and the condition should be searched particularly in patients with migraine with occipital and parieto-occipital calcification at brain neuroimaging. In those patients, gluten-free diet can also be effective in reducing migraine frequency. It has also been proposed that migraine may be improved by dietary approaches with beneficial effects on gut microbiota and gut-brain axis including appropriate consumption of fiber per day, adhering to a low glycemic index diet, supplementation with vitamin D, omega- and probiotics as well as weight loss dietary plans for overweight and obese patients."

Nonetheless, gastric cancer remains a major public health issue as the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Demographic trends differ by tumor location and histology. While there has been a marked decline in distal, intestinal type gastric cancers, the incidence of proximal, diffuse type adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia has been increasing, particularly in the Western countries. Incidence by tumor sub-site also varies widely based on geographic location, race, and socio-economic status. Distal gastric cancer predominates in developing countries, among blacks, and in lower socio-economic groups, whereas proximal tumors are more common in developed countries, among whites, and in higher socio-economic classes. Diverging trends in the incidence of gastric cancer by tumor location suggest that they may represent two diseases with different etiologies. The main risk factors for distal gastric cancer include Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection and dietary factors, whereas gastroesophageal reflux disease and obesity play important roles in the development of proximal stomach cancer. The purpose of this review is to examine the epidemiology and risk factors of gastric cancer, and to discuss strategies for primary prevention."

A complex interaction of autoantibodies against the parietal cell proton pump and sensitized T cells progressively destroy the parietal cells, inducing hypochlorhydria and then achlorhydria, while autoantibodies against the intrinsic factor impair the absorption of vitamin B₁₂. The resulting cobalamin deficiency manifests with megaloblastic anaemia and neurological and systemic signs and symptoms collectively known as pernicious anaemia. Previously believed to be predominantly a disease of elderly women of Northern European ancestry, autoimmune gastritis has now been recognized in all populations and ethnic groups, but because of the complexity of the diagnosis no reliable prevalence data are available. For similar reasons, as well as the frequent and often unknown overlap with Helicobacter pylori infection, the risk of gastric cancer has not been adequately assessed in these patients.

Oral lesions may be caused by drugs such as cyclosporine and sirolimus, by virus or fungal infections. Leukoplakia may develop in patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The commonest esophageal disorder is represented by fungal esophagitis usually caused by candida. A number of patients may suffer from nausea, vomiting and gastric discomfort. These disorders are more frequent in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Peptic ulcer is more rare than in the past. Patients with a history of peptic ulcer are particularly prone to this complication. Other gastroduodenal disorders are caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex infection. Diarrhea is a frequent disorder which may be caused by pathogen microorganisms or by immunosuppressive agents. The differential diagnosis may be difficult. Colon disorders mainly consist of hemorrhage, usually sustained by CMV infection, or perforation which may be caused by diverticulitis or intestinal ischemia. Colon cancer, anal carcinoma, and EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders are particularly frequent in transplant recipients.

Numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of L. casei or the L. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as Escherichia coli strain Nissle , certain enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) and the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. Among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are basic mechanisms. They are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. In addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. Well-established probiotic effects are: . Prevention and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. . Reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. . Prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. . Beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, Helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. . Normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. . Prevention or alleviation of allergies and atopic diseases in infants. . Prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. Insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). A prebiotic is ""a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health"", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. Today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for prebiotic classification. They are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. Other health effects of prebiotics (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect, i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. In the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides."

At least different alpha-CA isoforms were isolated in mammals, where these enzymes play crucial physiological roles. Representatives of the beta-delta-CA family are highly abundant in plants, diatoms, eubacteria and archaea. These enzymes are efficient catalysts for the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate, but at least the alpha-CAs possess a high versatility, being able to catalyze different other hydrolytic processes The catalytic mechanism of the alpha-CAs is understood in detail: the active site consists of a Zn(II) ion co-ordinated by three histidine residues and a water molecule/hydroxide ion. The latter is the active species, acting as a potent nucleophile. For beta- and gamma-CAs, the zinc hydroxide mechanism is valid too, although at least some beta-class enzymes do not have water directly coordinated to the metal ion. CAs are inhibited by two classes of compounds: the metal complexing anions and the sulfonamides and their isosteres (sulfamates, sulfamides etc.) possessing the general formula RXSO()NH() (R = aryl; hetaryl; perhaloalkyl; X = nothing, O or NH). At least clinically used drugs/agents in clinical development show applications as diuretics and antiglaucoma drugs, anticonvulsants, with some compounds being developed as anticancer agents/diagnostic tools for tumors, antiobesity agents, and antimicrobials/antifungals (inhibitors targeting CAs from pathogenic organisms such as Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Plasmodium falciparum, Candida albicans, etc). Several important physiological and physio-pathological functions are played by CA isozymes present in organisms all over the phylogenetic tree, related to respiration and transport of CO()/bicarbonate between metabolizing tissues and the lungs, pH and CO() homeostasis, electrolyte secretion in a variety of tissues/organs, biosynthetic reactions, such as the gluconeogenesis and ureagenesis among others (in animals), CO() fixation (in plants and algae), etc. The presence of these ubiquitous enzymes in so many tissues and in so different isoforms, represents an attractive goal for the design of inhibitors or activators with biomedical applications."

We determined whether there is an increased need for thyroxine in patients with euthyroid multinodular goiter and impaired secretion of gastric acid. METHODS: We assessed the dose of thyroxine required to obtain a low level of thyrotropin ( to mU per liter) in patients with multinodular goiter. Of these patients, also had Helicobacter pylori-related gastritis and had atrophic gastritis of the body of the stomach ( with evidence of H. pylori infection and without such evidence). The reference group comprised patients with multinodular goiter and no gastric disorders. In addition, variation in the level of serum thyrotropin was prospectively studied in patients treated with thyroxine before and after H. pylori infection and both before and during treatment with omeprazole in patients treated with thyroxine who had gastroesophageal reflux. RESULTS: The daily requirement of thyroxine was higher (by to percent) in patients with H. pylori-related gastritis, atrophic gastritis, or both conditions than in the reference group. In prospective studies, the occurrence of H. pylori infection in the patients treated with thyroxine led to an increase in the level of serum thyrotropin (P=), an effect that was nearly reversed on eradication of H. pylori infection. In a similar way, omeprazole treatment was associated with an increase in the level of serum thyrotropin in all patients treated with thyroxine, an effect that was reversed by an increase in the thyroxine dose by percent. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with impaired acid secretion require an increased dose of thyroxine, suggesting that normal gastric acid secretion is necessary for effective absorption of oral thyroxine."

We propose that integrins are exploited by the gastric pathogen and type- carcinogen Helicobacter pylori for injection of the bacterial oncoprotein cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) into gastric epithelial cells. Virulent H. pylori express a type-IV secretion pilus that injects CagA into the host cell; CagA then becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src family kinases. However, the identity of the host cell receptor involved in this process has remained unknown. Here we show that the H. pylori CagL protein is a specialized adhesin that is targeted to the pilus surface, where it binds to and activates integrin alpha5beta1 receptor on gastric epithelial cells through an arginine-glycine-aspartate motif. This interaction triggers CagA delivery into target cells as well as activation of focal adhesion kinase and Src. Our findings provide insights into the role of integrins in H.-pylori-induced pathogenesis. CagL may be exploited as a new molecular tool for our further understanding of integrin signalling."

The highest gallbladder cancer incidence rates worldwide were reported for women in Delhi, India (/,), South Karachi, Pakistan (/,) and Quito, Ecuador (/,). High incidence was found in Korea and Japan and some central and eastern European countries.

The aim was the evaluation of Hp infection in patients with NAFLD and its association with disease severity. METHODS: patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD ( with simple nonalcoholic fatty liver [NAFL], with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]) and matched healthy controls were recruited. Blood samples for anti-Hp Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and standard biochemical tests were obtained after overnight fasting, and ()C urea breath test was performed before liver biopsy in NAFLD group. RESULTS: Higher rates of anti-Hp IgG (P=.) were observed in NAFLD compared to control group. Only two NAFLD patients neither were Hp IgG seropositive nor did they have a history of eradication treatment compared to control subjects (P=.). Both Hp infection (assessed by history of Hp eradication treatment and/or Hp IgG seropositivity) (P=.) and log(HOMA-IR) (P=.) could independently predict NAFLD in logistic regression analysis. There were similar rates of Hp IgG seropositivity or positivity in ()C urea breath test or their combination between NAFL and NASH patients. There were no significant differences in steatosis grade, fibrosis stage, lobular or portal inflammation, or ballooning, when NAFLD patients were divided according to Hp IgG seropositivity or ()C urea breath test positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Hp infection may represent one more hit contributing to the pathogenesis of NAFL, though not to the progression from NAFL to NASH. These results warrant further validation. If confirmed, eradicating Hp infection may have certain therapeutic perspectives in NAFLD treatment."

The group recognized that in addition to long-established indications, such as peptic ulcer disease, early mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type lymphoma and family history of gastric cancer, H. pylori eradication was also indicated for H. pylori infected patients with functional dyspepsia, in those receiving long-term maintenance proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for gastroesophageal reflux disease, and in cases of unexplained iron deficiency anemia or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. In addition, a population 'test and treat' strategy for H. pylori infection in communities with high incidence of gastric cancer was considered to be an effective strategy for gastric cancer prevention. It was recommended that H. pylori infection should be tested for and eradicated prior to long-term aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy in patients at high risk for ulcers and ulcer-related complications. In Asia, the currently recommended first-line therapy for H. pylori infection is PPI-based triple therapy with amoxicillin/metronidazole and clarithromycin for days, while bismuth-based quadruple therapy is an effective alternative. There appears to be an increasing rate of resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole in parts of Asia, leading to reduced efficacy of PPI-based triple therapy. There are insufficient data to recommend sequential therapy as an alternative first-line therapy in Asia. Salvage therapies that can be used include: (i) standard triple therapy that has not been previously used; (ii) bismuth-based quadruple therapy; (iii) levofloxacin-based triple therapy; and (iv) rifabutin-based triple therapy. Both CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms and cigarette smoking can influence future H. pylori eradication rates."

The prevalence of H. pylori infection is gradually decreasing with improvement of living conditions and eradication therapy. However, some reports have described cases of H. pylori-negative gastric cancers (HpNGC), and the prevalence was -% of all gastric cancers. Diagnostic criteria of HpNGC vary among the different reports; thus, they have not yet been definitively established. We recommend negative findings in two or more methods that include endoscopic or pathological findings or serum pepsinogen test, and negative urease breath test or serum immunoglobulin G test and no eradication history the minimum criteria for diagnosis of HpNGC. The etiology of gastric cancers, excluding H. pylori infection, is known to be associated with several factors including lifestyle, viral infection, autoimmune disorder and germline mutations, but the main causal factor of HpNGC is still unclear. Regarding the characteristics of HpNGC, the undifferentiated type (UD-type) is more frequent than the differentiated type (D-type). The UD-type is mainly signet ring-cell carcinoma that presents as a discolored lesion in the lower or middle part of the stomach in relatively young patients. The gross type is flat or depressed. The D-type is mainly gastric adenocarcinoma of the fundic gland type that presents as a submucosal tumor-like or flat or depressed lesion in the middle and upper part of the stomach in relatively older patients. Early detection of HpNGC enables minimally invasive treatment which preserves the patient's quality of life. Endoscopists should fully understand the characteristics and endoscopic findings of HpNGC."

Unless treated, colonization usually persists lifelong. H. pylori infection represents a key factor in the etiology of various gastrointestinal diseases, ranging from chronic active gastritis without clinical symptoms to peptic ulceration, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Disease outcome is the result of the complex interplay between the host and the bacterium. Host immune gene polymorphisms and gastric acid secretion largely determine the bacterium's ability to colonize a specific gastric niche. Bacterial virulence factors such as the cytotoxin-associated gene pathogenicity island-encoded protein CagA and the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA aid in this colonization of the gastric mucosa and subsequently seem to modulate the host's immune system. This review focuses on the microbiological, clinical, immunological, and biochemical aspects of the pathogenesis of H. pylori."

Molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance have been intensively studied and are discussed in this Review. Three profiles of resistance - single drug resistance, multidrug resistance and heteroresistance - seem to occur, probably with overlapping fundamental mechanisms and clinical implications. The mechanisms that have been most studied are related to mutational changes encoded chromosomally and disrupt the cellular activity of antibiotics through target-mediated mechanisms. Other biological attributes driving drug resistance in H. pylori have been less explored and this could imply more complex physiological changes (such as impaired regulation of drug uptake and/or efflux, or biofilm and coccoid formation) that remain largely elusive. Resistance-related attributes deployed by the pathogen cause treatment failures, diagnostic difficulties and ambiguity in clinical interpretation of therapeutic outcomes. Subsequent to the increasing antibiotic resistance, a substantial drop in H. pylori treatment efficacy has been noted globally. In the absence of an efficient vaccine, enhanced efforts are needed for setting new treatment strategies and for a better understanding of the emergence and spread of drug-resistant bacteria, as well as for improving diagnostic tools that can help optimize current antimicrobial regimens."

Each one of them has been associated with advantages and disadvantages. Noninvasive tests such as serology, ()C urea breath test (UBT) and stool antigen tests are usually preferred by the clinicians. Serology has its own limitation especially in endemic areas while ()C UBT is technically very demanding. The stool antigen detection method, although specific, is usually associated with poor sensitivity. The ()C UBT is believed to be specific, but with present revelation of the fact that stomach is colonized by many other urease producing bacteria makes it questionable. Histology, culture, rapid urease test and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are the tests which are carried out on antral biopsies collected by invasive means. Histology has been proposed to be very sensitive and specific but the question is how by simply looking the morphology of the bacteria in the microscope, one can claim that the curved bacterium is exclusively H. pylori. Rapid urease test (RUT), the doctor's test, is also challenged because the presence of other urease producing bacteria in the stomach cannot be denied. Moreover, RUT has been reported with poor sensitivity specially, when density of the bacterium is low. Isolation of H. pylori is essential to investigate its growth requirements, antibiotic susceptibility testing, studying virulence factor to develop vaccine and many more explorations. It has also got several disadvantages i.e., special condition for transporting, media, incubation and few days waiting for the colonies to appear, apart from the speed essentially needed to process the specimens. Till date, majority of the microbiological laboratories in the world are not equipped and trained to isolate such fastidious bacterium. The option left is PCR methods to detect H. pylori's DNA in gastric mucosa, gastric juice, saliva, dental plaques and environmental specimens. There are speculations for false positivity due to detection of non-pylori Helicobacters due to genetic sharing; and false negativity due to low bacterial counts and presence of PCR inhibitors. However, specimen collection, transportation and processing do not require speed and special conditions. PCR based diagnosis may be considered as gold standard by designing primers extremely specific to H. pylori and targeting at least more than one conserved genes. Similarly specificity of PCR may be improved by use of internal Primers. Further, nested PCR will take care of false negatives by countering the effect of PCR inhibitors and low bacterial counts. Therefore, nested PCR based methods if performed properly, may be proposed as gold standard test."

Previously, autoantibodies directed against melanocortin peptides were found in patients with eating disorders; however, it remains unknown whether autoantibodies directed against other appetite-regulating peptides are present in human sera and whether their levels are influenced by gut-related antigens. METHODS: Healthy women were studied for the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA autoantibodies directed against key appetite-regulating peptides. The concept of molecular mimicry was applied to search in silico whether bacteria, viruses, or fungi contain proteins with amino acid sequences identical to appetite-regulating peptides. In addition, autoantibodies serum levels were studied in germ-free and specific pathogen-free rats. RESULTS: We found these IgG and IgA autoantibodies directed against leptin, ghrelin, peptide YY, neuropeptide Y, and other appetite-regulating peptides are present in human sera at levels of - ng/mL. Numerous cases of sequence homology with these peptides were identified among commensal and pathogenic micro-organisms including Lactobacilli, bacteroides, Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, and Candida species. Decreased levels of IgA autoantibodies directed against several appetite-regulating peptides and increased levels of antighrelin IgG were found in germ-free rats compared with specific pathogen-free rats. CONCLUSION: Healthy humans and rats display autoantibodies directed against appetite-regulating peptide hormones and neuropeptides, suggesting that these autoantibodies may have physiologic implications in hunger and satiety pathways. Gut-related antigens including the intestinal microflora may influence production of theses autoantibodies, suggesting a new link between the gut and appetite control."

We performed an umbrella review of meta-analyses to summarize available epidemiologic evidence and assess its credibility. METHODS: We systematically identified and appraised meta-analyses of observational studies examining environmental factors and risk of IBD (Crohn's disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis [UC]). For each meta-analysis, we considered the random effects estimate, its % confidence interval, the estimates of heterogeneity, and small-study effects, and we graded the evidence according to prespecified criteria. Methodologic quality was assessed with AMSTAR (ie, A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) . RESULTS: We examined estimates in meta-analyses of environmental factors related to lifestyles and hygiene, surgeries, drug exposures, diet, microorganisms, and vaccinations. We identified factors that increase risk of IBD: smoking (CD), urban living (CD and IBD), appendectomy (CD), tonsillectomy (CD), antibiotic exposure (IBD), oral contraceptive use (IBD), consumption of soft drinks (UC), vitamin D deficiency (IBD), and non-Helicobacter pylori-like enterohepatic Helicobacter species (IBD). We identified factors that reduce risk of IBD: physical activity (CD), breastfeeding (IBD), bed sharing (CD), tea consumption (UC), high levels of folate (IBD), high levels of vitamin D (CD), and H pylori infection (CD, UC, and IBD). Epidemiologic evidence for all of these associations was of high to moderate strength; we identified another factors associated with increased risk and factors associated with reduced risk with weak credibility. Methodologic quality varied considerably among meta-analyses. Several associations were based on findings from retrospective studies, so it is not possible to determine if these are effects of IBD or the results of recall bias. CONCLUSIONS: In an umbrella review of meta-analyses, we found varying levels of evidence for associations of different environmental factors with risk of IBD. High-quality prospective studies with analyses of samples from patients with recent diagnoses of IBD are needed to determine whether these factors cause or are results of IBD and their pathogenic mechanisms."

These studies indicate that the ClpX power stroke is generated by ATP hydrolysis in a single subunit, rule out concerted and strict sequential ATP hydrolysis models, and provide evidence for a probabilistic sequence of nucleotide hydrolysis. This mechanism would allow any ClpX subunit in contact with a translocating polypeptide to hydrolyse ATP to drive substrate spooling into ClpP, and would prevent stalling if one subunit failed to bind or hydrolyse ATP. Energy-dependent machines with highly diverse quaternary architectures and molecular functions could operate by similar asymmetric mechanisms."

Both experimental and clinical pharmacology clearly show that this compound is a nonsystemic antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antibacterial action covering Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, both aerobes and anaerobes. Being virtually nonabsorbed, its bioavailability within the GI tract is rather high with intraluminal and fecal drug concentrations that largely exceed the minimal inhibitory concentration values observed in vitro against a wide range of pathogenic organisms. The GI tract represents, therefore, the primary therapeutic target and GI infections the main indication. The appreciation of the pathogenic role of gut bacteria in several organic and functional GI diseases has increasingly broadened its clinical use, which is now extended to hepatic encephalopathy, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease and colonic diverticular disease. Potential indications include the irritable bowel syndrome and chronic constipation, Clostridium difficile infection and bowel preparation before colorectal surgery. Because of its antibacterial activity against the microorganism and the lack of strains with primary resistance, some preliminary studies have explored the rifaximin potential for Helicobacter pylori eradication. Oral administration of this drug, by getting rid of enteric bacteria, could also be employed to achieve selective bowel decontamination in acute pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis (thus preventing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use (lessening in that way NSAID enteropathy). This antibiotic has, therefore, little value outside the enteric area and this will minimize both antimicrobial resistance and systemic adverse events. Indeed, the drug proved to be safe in all patient populations, including young children. Although rifaximin has stood the test of time, it still attracts the attention of both basic scientists and clinicians. As a matter of fact, with the advancement of the knowledge on microbial-gut interactions in health and disease novel indications and new drug regimens are being explored. Besides widening the clinical use, the research on rifaximin is also focused on the synthesis of new derivatives and on the development of original formulations designed to expand the spectrum of its clinical use."

The multifaceted role of the gastrointestinal system in Parkinson's disease necessitates a specific and detailed assessment and treatment plan. The presence of pervasive α-synuclein deposition in the gastrointestinal tract strongly implicates this system in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.

Polymedication and genetic polymorphisms modulating drug-metabolising enzyme activities (cytochromes P450, CYP) are identified sources of variability in drug responses. We present here the relevant data on the clinical impact of the major CYP polymorphisms (CYP2D6, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9) on drug therapy where genotyping and phenotyping may be considered, and the guidelines developed when available. CYP2D6 is responsible for the oxidative metabolism of up to % of commonly prescribed drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, opioids, antiarrythmics and tamoxifen. The ultrarapid metaboliser (UM) phenotype is recognised as a cause of therapeutic inefficacy of antidepressant, whereas an increased risk of toxicity has been reported in poor metabolisers (PMs) with several psychotropics (desipramine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline, haloperidol). CYP2D6 polymorphism influences the analgesic response to prodrug opioids (codeine, tramadol and oxycodone). In PMs for CYP2D6, reduced analgesic effects have been observed, whereas in UMs cases of life-threatening toxicity have been reported with tramadol and codeine. CYP2D6 PM phenotype has been associated with an increased risk of toxicity of metoprolol, timolol, carvedilol and propafenone. Although conflicting results have been reported regarding the association between CYP2D6 genotype and tamoxifen effects, CYP2D6 genotyping may be useful in selecting adjuvant hormonal therapy in postmenopausal women. CYP2C19 is responsible for metabolising clopidogrel, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and some antidepressants. Carriers of CYP2C19 variant alleles exhibit a reduced capacity to produce the active metabolite of clopidogrel, and are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. For PPIs, it has been shown that the mean intragastric pH values and the Helicobacter pylori eradication rates were higher in carriers of CYP2C19 variant alleles. CYP2C19 is involved in the metabolism of several antidepressants. As a result of an increased risk of adverse effects in CYP2C19 PMs, dose reductions are recommended for some agents (imipramine, sertraline). CYP2C9 is responsible for metabolising vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sulfonylureas, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and phenytoin. For VKAs, CYP2C9 polymorphism has been associated with lower doses, longer time to reach treatment stability and higher frequencies of supratherapeutic international normalised ratios (INRs). Prescribing algorithms are available in order to adapt dosing to genotype. Although the existing data are controversial, some studies have suggested an increased risk of NSAID-associated gastrointestinal bleeding in carriers of CYP2C9 variant alleles. A relationship between CYP2C9 polymorphisms and the pharmacokinetics of sulfonylureas and angiotensin II receptor antagonists has also been observed. The clinical impact in terms of hypoglycaemia and blood pressure was, however, modest. Finally, homozygous and heterozygous carriers of CYP2C9 variant alleles require lower doses of phenytoin to reach therapeutic plasma concentrations, and are at increased risk of toxicity. New diagnostic techniques made safer and easier should allow quicker diagnosis of metabolic variations. Genotyping and phenotyping may therefore be considered where dosing guidelines according to CYP genotype have been published, and help identify the right molecule for the right patient."

The TLR4+896A>G polymorphism linked with impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide may play a role in gastric carcinogenesis. METHODS: We assessed associations with premalignant gastric changes in relatives of gastric cancer patients, including with hypochlorhydria and gastric atrophy. We also genotyped independent Caucasian population-based case-control studies of upper gastrointestinal tract cancer, initially in noncardia gastric carcinoma cases and controls and then in noncardia gastric carcinomas, cardia carcinomas, esophageal cancers, and frequency-matched controls. Odds ratios were computed from logistic models and adjusted for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: TLR4+896G carriers had an -fold (% confidence interval [CI], -) increased odds ratio (OR) for hypochlorhydria; the polymorphism was unassociated with gastric acid output in the absence of H pylori infection. Carriers also had significantly more severe gastric atrophy and inflammation. Seventeen percent of gastric carcinoma patients in the initial study and % of the noncardia gastric carcinoma patients in the replication study had or TLR4 variant alleles vs % of both control populations (combined OR = ; % CI = -). In contrast, prevalence of TLR4+896G was not significantly increased in esophageal squamous cell (%, OR = ) or adenocarcinoma (%, OR = ) or gastric cardia carcinoma (%, OR = ). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the TLR4+896A>G polymorphism is a risk factor for noncardia gastric carcinoma and its precursors. The findings underscore the role of the host innate immune response in outcome of H pylori infection."

When present, H pylori is usually the numerically dominant gastric microorganism. H pylori typically does not cause any adverse effects, but it is associated with an increased risk of noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, gastric lymphoma, and peptic ulcer. Disorders such as esophageal diseases and childhood-onset asthma were recently reported to occur more frequently in individuals who lack H pylori than in H pylori-positive persons. In this review, we discuss biologic factors that allow H pylori to colonize the human stomach, mechanisms by which H pylori increases the risk of peptic ulcer disease and noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, and potential benefits that H pylori might confer to humans."

Infections by Enterobacteriaceae producing metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs), e.g., New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM-) are very difficult to treat. Development of effective MBL inhibitors to revive the efficacy of existing antibiotics is highly desirable. However, such inhibitors are not clinically available till now. Here we show that an anti-Helicobacter pylori drug, colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS), and related Bi(III) compounds irreversibly inhibit different types of MBLs via the mechanism, with one Bi(III) displacing two Zn(II) ions as revealed by X-ray crystallography, leading to the release of Zn(II) cofactors. CBS restores meropenem (MER) efficacy against MBL-positive bacteria in vitro, and in mice infection model, importantly, also slows down the development of higher-level resistance in NDM--positive bacteria. This study demonstrates a high potential of Bi(III) compounds as the first broad-spectrum B1 MBL inhibitors to treat MBL-positive bacterial infection in conjunction with existing carbapenems."

In recent years, evidence has accumulated that immunoblot (western blot) is more sensitive for detection of anti-H. pylori antibodies than ELISA, the detection method used in our previous analysis. The purpose of this short report is to update the attributable fraction (AF) estimate for H. pylori after briefly reviewing new evidence, and to reassess the global burden of cancer attributable to H. pylori. We therefore reviewed the literature for studies comparing the risk of developing non-cardia gastric cancer (NCGC) in cases and controls, using both ELISA and multiple antigen immunoblot for detection of H. pylori. The results from prospective studies were combined, and the new pooled estimates were applied to the calculation of the AF for H. pylori in NCGC, then to the burden of infection-related cancers worldwide. Using the immunoblot-based data, the worldwide AF for H. pylori in NCGC increased from % to %. This implies approximately , additional cases of NCGC attributable to H. pylori infection for a total of around , cases (% instead of % of all cancers). These updated estimates reinforce the role of H. pylori as a major cause of cancer."

The prevalence and mechanism of resistance, the different methods to detect it and the clinical implication of resistance were addressed in several research papers last year. RECENT FINDINGS: Clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori has been recognized by the WHO as 'high priority', for which new antibiotics are needed. Moreover, the Maastricht consensus recommended, in areas with high resistance, that susceptibility tests should be performed, at least after a treatment failure. SUMMARY: Metronidazole and clarithromycin resistance rates are alarming although they vary among populations. Tetracycline and amoxicillin-resistance are very low in most countries. H. pylori resistance can be detected by phenotypic or by molecular methods. Different break points may be used when performing an antimicrobial susceptibility test, so comparing resistance among different populations is challenging. Genomic techniques open new possibilities in the diagnosis of H. pylori, and the detection of H. pylori and its antimicrobial resistance in faeces is an interesting approach. Eradication rates are dependent on the susceptibility of the strain to metronidazole and clarithromycin, being lower in patients infected with a resistant strain."

In selenium deficiency, benign strains of Coxsackie and influenza viruses can mutate to highly pathogenic strains. Dietary supplementation to provide adequate or supranutritional selenium supply has been proposed to confer health benefits for patients suffering from some viral diseases, most notably with respect to HIV and influenza A virus (IAV) infections. In addition, selenium-containing multimicronutrient supplements improved several clinical and lifestyle variables in patients coinfected with HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Selenium status may affect the function of cells of both adaptive and innate immunity. Supranutritional selenium promotes proliferation and favors differentiation of naive CD4-positive T lymphocytes toward T helper cells, thus supporting the acute cellular immune response, whereas excessive activation of the immune system and ensuing host tissue damage are counteracted through directing macrophages toward the M2 phenotype. This review provides an up-to-date overview on selenium in infectious diseases caused by viruses (e.g., HIV, IAV, hepatitis C virus, poliovirus, West Nile virus) and bacteria (e.g., M. tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori). Data from epidemiologic studies and intervention trials, with selenium alone or in combination with other micronutrients, and animal experiments are discussed against the background of dietary selenium requirements to alter immune functions."

After H. pylori enters the host stomach, four steps are critical for bacteria to establish successful colonization, persistent infection, and disease pathogenesis: () Survival in the acidic stomach; () movement toward epithelium cells by flagella-mediated motility; () attachment to host cells by adhesins/receptors interaction; () causing tissue damage by toxin release. Over the past years, the understanding of H. pylori pathogenesis has been improved by studies focusing on the host and bacterial factors through epidemiology researches and molecular mechanism investigations. These include studies identifying the roles of novel virulence factors and their association with different disease outcomes, especially the bacterial adhesins, cag pathogenicity island, and vacuolating cytotoxin. Recently, the development of large-scale screening methods, including proteomic, and transcriptomic tools, has been used to determine the complex gene regulatory networks in H. pylori. In addition, a more available complete genomic database of H. pylori strains isolated from patients with different gastrointestinal diseases worldwide is helpful to characterize this bacterium. This review highlights the key findings of H. pylori virulence factors reported over the past years."

Reduction of gastric cancer mortality by the screening was documented in Japan, but the Japanese gastric cancer screening with the X-ray photofluorography is criticized for its high cost and a low uptake rate. Although the Korean program seems to achieve a high-rate of uptake with increasing use of endoscopy, the work load is substantial. In the meantime, more attention in the world turns to primary prevention through eradication of Helicobacter pylori. Indeed, fairly large-scale studies to examine the feasibility of mass-eradication to prevent gastric cancer are underway in China and Taiwan. In the future, gastric cancer screening should incorporate 'screen to treat' of H. pylori infection at younger age followed by endoscopic surveillance for subjects at risk."

METHODS: The presence of Helicobacter species was tested by polymerase chain reaction on liver samples from four groups of patients. RESULTS: Helicobacter 16S rDNA was found in only % of liver samples from control patients (n=) and in % of liver samples from patients with non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis C (n=) while it was found in % of liver samples from patients with HCV positive cirrhosis without HCC (n=) as well as in % of cirrhotic liver samples from patients with HCV positive cirrhosis and HCC (n=).

Although large amount of PPIs data for different species has been generated by high-throughput experimental techniques, current PPI pairs obtained with experimental methods cover only a fraction of the complete PPI networks, and further, the experimental methods for identifying PPIs are both time-consuming and expensive. Hence, it is urgent and challenging to develop automated computational methods to efficiently and accurately predict PPIs. RESULTS: We present here a novel hierarchical PCA-EELM (principal component analysis-ensemble extreme learning machine) model to predict protein-protein interactions only using the information of protein sequences. In the proposed method, protein pairs retrieved from the DIP database were encoded into feature vectors by using four kinds of protein sequences information. Focusing on dimension reduction, an effective feature extraction method PCA was then employed to construct the most discriminative new feature set. Finally, multiple extreme learning machines were trained and then aggregated into a consensus classifier by majority voting. The ensembling of extreme learning machine removes the dependence of results on initial random weights and improves the prediction performance. CONCLUSIONS: When performed on the PPI data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the proposed method achieved % prediction accuracy with % sensitivity at the precision of %. Extensive experiments are performed to compare our method with state-of-the-art techniques Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results demonstrate that proposed PCA-EELM outperforms the SVM method by -fold cross-validation. Besides, PCA-EELM performs faster than PCA-SVM based method. Consequently, the proposed approach can be considered as a new promising and powerful tools for predicting PPI with excellent performance and less time."

Independently of asthma, risk of mild COPD in nonsmokers increased with age (doubling every years), before age was lower among men than women, and was inversely associated with current exposure to tobacco smoke at home and at work. In contrast, the risk of moderate-to-severe COPD in nonsmokers was markedly associated with male gender, peaked in middle age, and was inversely associated with nonwhite ethnicity. COPD risks did not vary by minimal smoking history, longest-held occupation, urban residence, income, allergies, thyroid disease, or Helicobacter pylori antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Among nonsmokers, mild and moderate-to-severe COPD are associated with asthma but otherwise have distinct demographic profiles, suggesting that moderate-to-severe disease is not a mere progression of mild COPD."

The bacterium has now been accepted as the causative agent of several gastroduodenal disorders, ranging from chronic active gastritis and peptic ulcer disease to gastric cancer. The recognition of H pylori as a gastric pathogen has had a substantial effect on gastroenterological practice, since many untreatable gastroduodenal disorders with uncertain cause became curable infectious diseases. Treatment of H pylori infection results in ulcer healing and can reduce the risk of gastric cancer development. Although H pylori is susceptible to many antibiotics in vitro, only a few antibiotics can be used in vivo to cure the infection. The frequent indication for anti-H pylori therapy, together with the limited choice of antibiotics, has resulted in the development of antibiotic resistance in H pylori, which substantially impairs the treatment of H pylori-associated disorders. Antimicrobial resistance in H pylori is widespread, and although the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance shows regional variation per antibiotic, it can be as high as %. We focus on the treatment of H pylori infection and on the clinical relevance, mechanisms, and diagnosis of antimicrobial resistance."

Infection with this ubiquitous bacterium incites a chronic active immune response that persists for the life of the host, in the absence of antibiotic-induced eradication. It is the combination of bacterial factors, environmental insults, and the host immune response that drives the initiation and progression of mucosal atrophy, metaplasia, and dysplasia toward gastric cancer. Although it may seem intuitively obvious that removing the offending organism would negate the cancer risk, this approach is neither feasible (half of the world harbors this infection) nor is it straightforward. Most patients are infected in childhood, and present with various degrees of mucosal damage before any therapy. This review outlines the histologic progression of human Helicobacter infection from the early stages of inflammation through the development of metaplasia, dysplasia, and, finally, cancer. The effects of dietary and bacterial eradication therapy on disease progression and lesion reversibility are reviewed within the context of population studies and compared between study designs and populations tested. Eradication studies in the mouse model of infection prevents the formation of gastric cancer, and allows regression of established lesions, providing a useful model to study interaction between bacterium, environment, and host, without the difficulties inherent in human population studies.

EoE has transformed from a rare case-reportable condition to disease that is commonly encountered in the gastroenterology clinic, hospital emergency room, and endoscopy suite. The incidence and prevalence are increasing at rates that outpace increased disease recognition. Current incidence estimates range from to cases per ,, and current prevalence estimates range from to case per . We review the data and potential reasons behind this increase, examine risk factors, and identify important areas for research into disease etiology. The article also discusses the progression of EoE from an inflammatory to fibrostenotic phenotype. An accurate view of the natural history of EoE is central to discussions with patients regarding disease prognosis and decisions about long-term use of medical, endoscopic, and diet therapies.

It was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of trichomoniasis, giardiasis, amebiasis, and amebic liver abscess. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties and clinical usefulness of tinidazole. METHODS: Relevant information was identified through a search of MEDLINE (-August ), Iowa Drug Information Service (-August ), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (-August ) using the terms tinidazole, Fasigyn, and nitroimidazole. RESULTS: In vitro, tinidazole exhibits activity against pathogenic protozoa (eg, Tricbomonas vaginalis, Entamoeba bistolytica, Giardia duodenalis), a wide range of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria (eg, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile), and the microaerophilic bacterium Helicobacter pylori. In susceptible protozoal and bacterial cells, tinidazole is reduced to cytotoxic intermediates that covalently bind to DNA, causing irreversible damage. In human adults, tinidazole had a bioavailability of % and a V(d) of L, was minimally bound to plasma protein (%), had a plasma elimination t((/)) of hours, and was eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism (approximately %). Dose adjustment does not appear to be necessary on the basis of race, sex, or renal function. No data were found on the disposition of tinidazole in patients with hepatic insufficiency; therefore, use of tinidazole in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) is not recommended. Clinical cure rates in patients with trichomoniasis, giardiasis, amebiasis, and amebic liver abscess were generally >%. In comparative trials, tinidazole was as effective as metronidazole in the treatment of trichomoniasis and was significantly more effective than metronidazole in the treatment of giardiasis (P < ) and amebiasis (P < ). The most commonly reported (>%) adverse effects included bitter taste, nausea, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, vomiting, and fatigue. The recommended dosage of tinidazole is a single dose of g for trichomoniasis and giardiasis, and g/d for to days for amebiasis. CONCLUSIONS: Tinidazole appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of trichomoniasis, giardiasis, amebiasis, and amebic liver abscess. Clinical studies are needed to evaluate the use of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria and H pylori."

An institutional quality assurance review. | Practical approach to the pathologic diagnosis of gastritis.,29543326,2018,172,,Non-invasive diagnostic tests for Helicobacter pylori infection.,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection has been implicated in a number of malignancies and non-malignant conditions including peptic ulcers, non-ulcer dyspepsia, recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding, unexplained iron deficiency anaemia, idiopathic thrombocytopaenia purpura, and colorectal adenomas. The confirmatory diagnosis of H pylori is by endoscopic biopsy, followed by histopathological examination using haemotoxylin and eosin (H & E) stain or special stains such as Giemsa stain and Warthin-Starry stain. Special stains are more accurate than H & E stain. There is significant uncertainty about the diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive tests for diagnosis of H pylori. OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of urea breath test, serology, and stool antigen test, used alone or in combination, for diagnosis of H pylori infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic people, so that eradication therapy for H pylori can be started. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Science Citation Index and the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Database on March . We screened references in the included studies to identify additional studies. We also conducted citation searches of relevant studies, most recently on December . We did not restrict studies by language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included diagnostic accuracy studies that evaluated at least one of the index tests (urea breath test using isotopes such as 13C or 14C, serology and stool antigen test) against the reference standard (histopathological examination using H & E stain, special stains or immunohistochemical stain) in people suspected of having H pylori infection. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the references to identify relevant studies and independently extracted data. We assessed the methodological quality of studies using the QUADAS- tool. We performed meta-analysis by using the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model to estimate and compare SROC curves. Where appropriate, we used bivariate or univariate logistic regression models to estimate summary sensitivities and specificities. MAIN RESULTS: We included studies involving , participants, of which participants (%) had H pylori infection. The prevalence of H pylori infection in the studies ranged from % to %, with a median prevalence of % (interquartile range % to %). Most of the studies (%) included participants with dyspepsia and studies excluded participants who recently had proton pump inhibitors or antibiotics.There was at least an unclear risk of bias or unclear applicability concern for each study.Of the studies, compared the accuracy of two index tests and two studies compared the accuracy of three index tests. Thirty-four studies ( participants) evaluated serology; studies ( participants) evaluated stool antigen test; studies ( participants) evaluated urea breath test-13C; studies ( participants) evaluated urea breath test-14C; and two studies ( participants) evaluated urea breath test but did not report the isotope used. The thresholds used to define test positivity and the staining techniques used for histopathological examination (reference standard) varied between studies. Due to sparse data for each threshold reported, it was not possible to identify the best threshold for each test.Using data from studies in an indirect test comparison, there was statistical evidence of a difference in diagnostic accuracy between urea breath test-13C, urea breath test-14C, serology and stool antigen test (P = ). The diagnostic odds ratios for urea breath test-13C, urea breath test-14C, serology, and stool antigen test were (% confidence interval (CI) to ), (% CI to ), (% CI to ) and (% CI to ). The sensitivity (% CI) estimated at a fixed specificity of (median from studies across the four tests), was (% CI to ) for urea breath test-13C, (% CI to ) for urea breath test-14C, (% CI to ) for serology, and (% CI to ) for stool antigen test. This implies that on average, given a specificity of and prevalence of % (median specificity and prevalence in the studies), out of people tested for H pylori infection, there will be false positives (people without H pylori infection who will be diagnosed as having H pylori infection). In this hypothetical cohort, urea breath test-13C, urea breath test-14C, serology, and stool antigen test will give (% CI to ), (% CI to ), (% CI to ), and (% CI to ) false negatives respectively (people with H pylori infection for whom the diagnosis of H pylori will be missed).Direct comparisons were based on few head-to-head studies. The ratios of diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) were (% CI to ; P = ) for urea breath test-13C versus serology (seven studies), and (% CI to ; P = ) for urea breath test-13C versus stool antigen test (seven studies). The % CIs of these estimates overlap with those of the ratios of DORs from the indirect comparison. Data were limited or unavailable for meta-analysis of other direct comparisons. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In people without a history of gastrectomy and those who have not recently had antibiotics or proton ,pump inhibitors, urea breath tests had high diagnostic accuracy while serology and stool antigen tests were less accurate for diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection.This is based on an indirect test comparison (with potential for bias due to confounding), as evidence from direct comparisons was limited or unavailable. The thresholds used for these tests were highly variable and we were unable to identify specific thresholds that might be useful in clinical practice.We need further comparative studies of high methodological quality to obtain more reliable evidence of relative accuracy between the tests. Such studies should be conducted prospectively in a representative spectrum of participants and clearly reported to ensure low risk of bias. Most importantly, studies should prespecify and clearly report thresholds used, and should avoid inappropriate exclusions."

DESIGN: Using mouse models, we evaluated whether immune checkpoint inhibitors or vaccine-based immunotherapies are effective in reducing tumour volumes of H. pylori-infected mice. In humans, we evaluated the correlation between H. pylori seropositivity and the efficacy of the programmed cell death protein (PD-) blockade therapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RESULTS: In mice engrafted with MC38 colon adenocarcinoma or B16-OVA melanoma cells, the tumour volumes of non-infected mice undergoing anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein and/or programmed death ligand or anti-cancer vaccine treatments were significantly smaller than those of infected mice. We observed a decreased number and activation status of tumour-specific CD8+ T cells in the tumours of infected mice treated with cancer immunotherapies independent of the gut microbiome composition. Additionally, by performing an in vitro co-culture assay, we observed that dendritic cells of infected mice promote lower tumour-specific CD8+ T cell proliferation. We performed retrospective human clinical studies in two independent cohorts. In the Dijon cohort, H. pylori seropositivity was found to be associated with a decreased NSCLC patient survival on anti-PD- therapy. The survival median for H. pylori seropositive patients was months compared with months for seronegative patients (p=). Additionally, in the Montreal cohort, H. pylori seropositivity was found to be associated with an apparent decrease of NSCLC patient progression-free survival on anti-PD- therapy. CONCLUSION: Our study unveils for the first time that the stomach microbiota affects the response to cancer immunotherapies and that H. pylori serology would be a powerful tool to personalize cancer immunotherapy treatment."

H. pylori is usually transmitted in childhood and persists for life if untreated. The infection affects around half of the population in the world but prevalence varies according to location and sanitation standards. H. pylori has unique properties to colonize gastric epithelium in an acidic environment. The pathophysiology of H. pylori infection is dependent on complex bacterial virulence mechanisms and their interaction with the host immune system and environmental factors, resulting in distinct gastritis phenotypes that determine possible progression to different gastroduodenal pathologies. The causative role of H. pylori infection in gastric cancer development presents the opportunity for preventive screen-and-treat strategies. Invasive, endoscopy-based and non-invasive methods, including breath, stool and serological tests, are used in the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. Their use depends on the specific individual patient history and local availability. H. pylori treatment consists of a strong acid suppressant in various combinations with antibiotics and/or bismuth. The dramatic increase in resistance to key antibiotics used in H. pylori eradication demands antibiotic susceptibility testing, surveillance of resistance and antibiotic stewardship."

This review will focus on the clinical applications of antimicrobial PDT. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: The published peer-reviewed literature was reviewed between and . RESULTS: The basics of antimicrobial PDT are discussed. Clinical applications of antimicrobial PDT to localized viral infections caused by herpes and papilloma viruses, and nonviral dermatological infections such as acne and other yeast, fungal and bacterial skin infections are covered. PDT has been used to treat bacterial infections in brain abscesses and non-healing ulcers. PDT for dental infections including periodontitis and endodontics has been well studied. PDT has also been used for cutaneous Leishmaniasis. Clinical trials of PDT and blue light alone therapy for gastric Helicobacter pylori infection are also covered.

We expect more to see applications of PDT to more challenging infections using advanced antimicrobial photosensitizers targeted to microbial cells in the years to come."

ParB (partition protein B) and its regulatory protein, ParA, act cooperatively through parS (partition S) DNA to facilitate chromosome segregation. ParB binds to chromosomal DNA at specific parS sites as well as the neighboring nonspecific DNA sites. Various ParB molecules can associate together and spread along the chromosomal DNA. ParB oligomer and parS DNA interact together to form a high-order nucleoprotein that is required for the loading of the structural maintenance of chromosomes proteins onto the chromosome for chromosomal DNA condensation. In this report, we characterized the binding of parS and Spo0J from Helicobacter pylori (HpSpo0J) and solved the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain truncated protein (Ct-HpSpo0J)-parS complex. Ct-HpSpo0J folds into an elongated structure that includes a flexible N-terminal domain for protein-protein interaction and a conserved DNA-binding domain for parS binding. Two Ct-HpSpo0J molecules bind with one parS. Ct-HpSpo0J interacts vertically and horizontally with its neighbors through the N-terminal domain to form an oligomer. These adjacent and transverse interactions are accomplished via a highly conserved arginine patch: RRLR. These interactions might be needed for molecular assembly of a high-order nucleoprotein complex and for ParB spreading. A structural model for ParB spreading and chromosomal DNA condensation that lead to chromosome segregation is proposed."

Although the effects of obesity on the development of metabolic and cardiovascular problems are well studied, much less is known about the impact of obesity on immune function and infectious disease. Studies in obese humans and with obese animal models have repeatedly demonstrated impaired immune function, including decreased cytokine production, decreased response to antigen/mitogen stimulation, reduced macrophage and dendritic cell function, and natural killer cell impairment. Recent studies have demonstrated that the impaired immune response in the obese host leads to increased susceptibility to infection with a number of different pathogens such as community-acquired tuberculosis, influenza, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, coxsackievirus, Helicobacter pylori and encephalomyocarditis virus. While no specific mechanism has been defined for the decreased immune response to infectious disease in the obese host, several obesity-associated changes such as excessive inflammation, altered adipokine signaling, metabolic changes and even epigenetic regulation could affect the immune response. This review will discuss what is currently known about the relationship between obesity and infectious disease."

We aim to establish clinically relevant molecular subtypes that would encompass this heterogeneity and provide useful clinical information. We use gene expression data to describe four molecular subtypes linked to distinct patterns of molecular alterations, disease progression and prognosis. The mesenchymal-like type includes diffuse-subtype tumors with the worst prognosis, the tendency to occur at an earlier age and the highest recurrence frequency (%) of the four subtypes. Microsatellite-unstable tumors are hyper-mutated intestinal-subtype tumors occurring in the antrum; these have the best overall prognosis and the lowest frequency of recurrence (%) of the four subtypes. The tumor protein (TP53)-active and TP53-inactive types include patients with intermediate prognosis and recurrence rates (with respect to the other two subtypes), with the TP53-active group showing better prognosis. We describe key molecular alterations in each of the four subtypes using targeted sequencing and genome-wide copy number microarrays. We validate these subtypes in independent cohorts in order to provide a consistent and unified framework for further clinical and preclinical translational research."

AIM: To review NVGI bleeding in cirrhosis. METHODS: MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI Web of Knowledge were searched, using the textwords ""portal hypertensive gastropathy,"" ""gastric vascular ectasia,"" ""peptic ulcer,"" ""Dieulafoy's,"" ""Mallory-Weiss syndrome,"" ""portal hypertensive enteropathy,"" ""portal hypertensive colopathy,"" ""hemorrhoids,"" and ""cirrhosis."" RESULTS: Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) and gastric vascular ectasia (GVE) are gastric lesions that most commonly present as chronic anemia; acute upper GI (UGI) bleeding is a rare manifestation. Management of PHG-related bleeding is mainly pharmacological, whereas endoscopic intervention is favored in GVE-related bleeding. Shunt therapies or more invasive techniques are restricted in refractory cases. Despite its high incidence in cirrhotic patients, peptic ulcer accounts for a relatively small proportion of UGI bleeding in this patient population. However, in contrary to general population, the pathogenetic role of Helicobacter pylori infection remains questionable. Finally, other causes of UGI bleeding include Dieulafoy's lesion, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, and portal hypertensive enteropathy. The most common non-variceal endoscopic findings reported in patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding are portal hypertensive colopathy and hemorrhoids. However, the vast majority of studies are case reports and, therefore, the incidence, diagnosis, and risk of bleeding remain undefined. Endoscopic interventions, shunting procedures, and surgical techniques have been described in this setting. CONCLUSIONS: The data on NVGI bleeding in liver cirrhosis are surprisingly scanty. Large, multicenter epidemiological studies are needed to better assess prevalence and incidence and, most importantly, randomized studies should be performed to evaluate the success rates of therapeutic algorithms."

METHODS: We analysed human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 and HLA-DPB1 alleles, and IgG antibodies against Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, varicella zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) in patients with NMO, including patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and unrelated healthy controls. NMO/NMOSD patients were seropositive for AQP4 antibody while were seronegative. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, NMO/NMOSD patients showed a significantly lower frequency of DRB1* and significantly higher frequencies of DRB1* and DPB1*, which conferred susceptibility to anti-AQP4 antibody positive NMO/NMOSD, but not antibody negative NMO/NMOSD. DRB1* was a common protective allele, irrespective of the presence or absence of anti-AQP4 antibody. Anti-H pylori and anti-C pneumoniae antibodies were more commonly detected in anti-AQP4 antibody positive NMO/NMOSD patients than healthy controls. Antibody negative NMO/NMOSD patients did not differ from healthy controls regarding the presence of these antibodies. The presence or absence of antibodies against varicella zoster virus and EBNA did not vary among the groups. The frequencies of antibodies against these four pathogens were not significantly different between MS patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HLA-DRB1* and DPB1* alleles and H pylori and Chlamydia pneumonia infection are risk factors only for anti-AQP4 antibody positive NMO/NMOSD but not for anti-AQP4 antibody negative NMO/NMOSD."
