Flavonoids are a family of plant-derived compounds with potentially exploitable activities, including direct antibacterial activity, synergism with antibiotics, and suppression of bacterial virulence. In this review, recent advances towards understanding these properties are described. Information is presented on the ten most potently antibacterial flavonoids as well as the five most synergistic flavonoid-antibiotic combinations tested in the last years (identified from PubMed and ScienceDirect). Top of these respective lists are panduratin A, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of - μg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus, and epicatechin gallate, which reduces oxacillin MICs as much as -fold. Research seeking to improve such activity and understand structure-activity relationships is discussed. Proposed mechanisms of action are also discussed. In addition to direct and synergistic activities, flavonoids inhibit a number of bacterial virulence factors, including quorum-sensing signal receptors, enzymes and toxins. Evidence of these molecular effects at the cellular level include in vitro inhibition of biofilm formation, inhibition of bacterial attachment to host ligands, and neutralisation of toxicity towards cultured human cells. In vivo evidence of disruption of bacterial pathogenesis includes demonstrated efficacy against Helicobacter pylori infection and S. aureus α-toxin intoxication."

Although lymphoma can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract, the most frequent sites in order of its occurrence are the stomach followed by small intestine and ileocecal region. Gastrointestinal tract lymphoma is usually secondary to the widespread nodal diseases and primary gastrointestinal tract lymphoma is relatively rare. Gastrointestinal lymphomas are usually not clinically specific and indistinguishable from other benign and malignant conditions. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common pathological type of gastrointestinal lymphoma in essentially all sites of the gastrointestinal tract, although recently the frequency of other forms has also increased in certain regions of the world. Although some radiological features such as bulky lymph nodes and maintenance of fat plane are more suggestive of lymphoma, they are not specific, thus mandating histopathological analysis for its definitive diagnosis. There has been a tremendous leap in the diagnosis, staging and management of gastrointestinal lymphoma in the last two decades attributed to a better insight into its etiology and molecular aspect as well as the knowledge about its critical signaling pathways."

The mesenchymal-like type includes diffuse-subtype tumors with the worst prognosis, the tendency to occur at an earlier age and the highest recurrence frequency (%) of the four subtypes. Microsatellite-unstable tumors are hyper-mutated intestinal-subtype tumors occurring in the antrum; these have the best overall prognosis and the lowest frequency of recurrence (%) of the four subtypes. The tumor protein (TP53)-active and TP53-inactive types include patients with intermediate prognosis and recurrence rates (with respect to the other two subtypes), with the TP53-active group showing better prognosis. We describe key molecular alterations in each of the four subtypes using targeted sequencing and genome-wide copy number microarrays. We validate these subtypes in independent cohorts in order to provide a consistent and unified framework for further clinical and preclinical translational research."

METHODS: A systematic review of the literature (time period: -) was performed. Representatives of both societies evaluated the quality of evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to formulate recommendations, which were voted upon and finalized using a Delphi process and face-to-face meeting. RESULTS: The consensus group recommended that invasive diagnostic testing for H pylori be performed only when treatment will be offered if tests are positive. To reach the aim of a % eradication rate with initial therapy, antibiotics should be tailored according to susceptibility testing. Therapy should be administered for days, emphasizing strict adherence. Clarithromycin-containing regimens should be restricted to children infected with susceptible strains. When antibiotic susceptibility profiles are not known, high-dose triple therapy with proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, and metronidazole for days or bismuth-based quadruple therapy is recommended. Success of therapy should be monitored after to weeks by reliable noninvasive tests. CONCLUSIONS: The primary goal of clinical investigation is to identify the cause of upper gastrointestinal symptoms rather than H pylori infection. Therefore, we recommend against a test and treat strategy. Decreasing eradication rates with previously recommended treatments call for changes to first-line therapies and broader availability of culture or molecular-based testing to tailor treatment to the individual child."

We analyzed data based on United Nations geoscheme regions and individual countries. We used a random effects model to calculate pooled prevalence estimates with % confidence intervals (CIs), weighted by study size. We extrapolated prevalence estimates to obtain the estimated number of individuals with H pylori infection. RESULTS: Among , reports screened, we identified full-text articles on the prevalence of H pylori infection; were included in the final analysis, comprising data from countries. Africa had the highest pooled prevalence of H pylori infection (%; % CI, -), whereas Oceania had the lowest prevalence (%; % CI, -). Among individual countries, the prevalence of H pylori infection varied from as low as % in Switzerland (% CI, -) to % in Nigeria (% CI, -). Based on regional prevalence estimates, there were approximately billion individuals with H pylori infection worldwide in . CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of H pylori infection worldwide, we observed large amounts of variation among regions-more than half the world's population is infected.

The vacuolating cytotoxin gene, vacA, is a major determinant of virulence. Two naturally polymorphic sites in vacA, the signal region and midregion, are well-characterized determinants of toxicity and markers of pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to characterize a new vacA polymorphic site, the intermediate (i) region. METHODS: The vacA i-region was identified and characterized by constructing isogenic vacA exchange mutants and determining their vacuolating activity on HeLa, AGS, and RK13 cell lines. The vacA i-region types of H pylori isolates from patients undergoing routine endoscopy were determined by nucleotide sequencing and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Two i-region types were identified, i1 and i2, and both were common among Western clinical isolates. Interestingly, only naturally occurring s1/m2 strains varied in i-type; s1/m1 and s2/m2 strains were exclusively i1 and i2, respectively. Vacuolation assays showed that i-type determined vacuolating activity among these s1/m2 strains, and exchange mutagenesis confirmed that the i-region itself was directly responsible. Using a simple i-region polymerase chain reaction-based typing system, it was shown for Iranian patients that i1-type strains were strongly associated with gastric adenocarcinoma (P < (-)). Finally, logistic regression analysis showed this association to be independent of, and larger than, associations of vacA s- or m-type or cag status with gastric adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Together these data show that the vacA i-region is an important determinant of H pylori toxicity and the best independent marker of VacA-associated pathogenicity."

Compared to monomer vaccines, nanoparticle vaccines elicited more robust neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses. RBD and RBD-HR nanoparticle vaccinated hACE2 transgenic mice vaccinated with RBD and/or RBD-HR nanoparticles exhibited reduced viral load in the lungs after SARS-CoV- challenge. RBD-HR nanoparticle vaccines also promoted neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses against other coronaviruses. The nanoparticle vaccination of rhesus macaques induced neutralizing antibodies, and T and B cell responses prior to boost immunization; these responses persisted for more than three months. RBD- and HR-based nanoparticles thus present a promising vaccination approach against SARS-CoV- and other coronaviruses."

However, a significant gap remains in moving nano/micromotors from test tubes to living organisms for treating diseases with high efficacy. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, in vivo therapeutic micromotors application for active drug delivery to treat gastric bacterial infection in a mouse model using clarithromycin as a model antibiotic and Helicobacter pylori infection as a model disease. The propulsion of drug-loaded magnesium micromotors in gastric media enables effective antibiotic delivery, leading to significant bacteria burden reduction in the mouse stomach compared with passive drug carriers, with no apparent toxicity. Moreover, while the drug-loaded micromotors reach similar therapeutic efficacy as the positive control of free drug plus proton pump inhibitor, the micromotors can function without proton pump inhibitors because of their built-in proton depletion function associated with their locomotion.Nano- and micromotors have been demonstrated in vitro for a range of applications. Here the authors demonstrate the in-vivo therapeutic use of micromotors to treat H. pylori infection."

Due to its large public health and societal implications, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis has been long regarded by WHO as a global priority for investment in new drugs. In , WHO was requested by member states to create a priority list of other antibiotic-resistant bacteria to support research and development of effective drugs. METHODS: We used a multicriteria decision analysis method to prioritise antibiotic-resistant bacteria; this method involved the identification of relevant criteria to assess priority against which each antibiotic-resistant bacterium was rated. The final priority ranking of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria was established after a preference-based survey was used to obtain expert weighting of criteria. FINDINGS: We selected bacterial species with patterns of acquired resistance and ten criteria to assess priority: mortality, health-care burden, community burden, prevalence of resistance, -year trend of resistance, transmissibility, preventability in the community setting, preventability in the health-care setting, treatability, and pipeline. We stratified the priority list into three tiers (critical, high, and medium priority), using the 33rd percentile of the bacterium's total scores as the cutoff. Critical-priority bacteria included carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and carbapenem-resistant and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The highest ranked Gram-positive bacteria (high priority) were vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Of the bacteria typically responsible for community-acquired infections, clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori, and fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter spp, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella typhi were included in the high-priority tier. INTERPRETATION: Future development strategies should focus on antibiotics that are active against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and Gram-negative bacteria. The global strategy should include antibiotic-resistant bacteria responsible for community-acquired infections such as Salmonella spp, Campylobacter spp, N gonorrhoeae, and H pylori.

Virulence factors include the cag pathogenicity island, which induces proinflammatory, pro-proliferative epithelial cell signaling; the cytotoxin VacA, which causes epithelial damage; and an adhesin, BabA. Host genetic polymorphisms that lead to high-level pro-inflammatory cytokine release in response to infection increase cancer risk. Pathogenesis is dependent upon inflammation, a Th- acquired immune response and hormonal changes including hypergastrinaemia. Antral-predominant inflammation leads to increased acid production from the uninflamed corpus and predisposes to duodenal ulceration; corpus-predominant gastritis leads to hypochlorhydria and predisposes to gastric ulceration and adenocarcinoma. Falling prevalence of H. pylori in developed countries has led to a falling incidence of associated diseases. However, whether there are disadvantages of an H. pylori-free stomach, for example increased risk of esosphageal adenocarcinoma, remains unclear."

Gastric cancer is diagnosed histologically after endoscopic biopsy and staged using CT, endoscopic ultrasound, PET, and laparoscopy. It is a molecularly and phenotypically highly heterogeneous disease. The main treatment for early gastric cancer is endoscopic resection. Non-early operable gastric cancer is treated with surgery, which should include D2 lymphadenectomy (including lymph node stations in the perigastric mesentery and along the celiac arterial branches). Perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in patients with stage 1B or higher cancers. Advanced gastric cancer is treated with sequential lines of chemotherapy, starting with a platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet in the first line; median survival is less than year. Targeted therapies licensed to treat gastric cancer include trastuzumab (HER2-positive patients first line), ramucirumab (anti-angiogenic second line), and nivolumab or pembrolizumab (anti-PD- third line)."

As histology reporting of hepatitis in terms of stage is clinically useful and widely accepted, an international group (Operative Link on Gastritis Assessment (OLGA)) proposed an equivalent staging system for reporting gastric histology. Gastritis staging integrates the atrophy score (obtained by biopsy) and the atrophy topography (achieved through directed biopsy mapping). AIM: To test in a prospective cross-sectional study whether OLGA staging consistently stratified patients according to their cancer risk and provided clear prognostic/therapeutic information. METHODS: OLGA staging for gastric cancer risk (-IV) and gastritis grading (overall score of the inflammatory infiltrate, grade -) were applied in prospectively enrolled, consecutive, dyspeptic outpatients who underwent endoscopy with standardised biopsy sampling. Incidental neoplastic lesions and coexisting peptic ulcers were recorded. Results were presented as stage (including antral (A) and corpus (C) atrophy scores) and H pylori status (eg, A = ; C = : stage IV; Hp+ve). RESULTS: Benign conditions (including duodenal ulcers; p<) consistently clustered in stages -II, whereas all neoplastic (invasive and non-invasive) lesions clustered in stages III-IV (p<).

This is a conditional recommendation and patients at higher risk of malignancy (such as spending their childhood in a high risk gastric cancer country or having a positive family history) could be offered an endoscopy at a younger age. Alarm features should not automatically precipitate endoscopy in younger patients but this should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

If these are ineffective tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or prokinetic therapies can be tried. Patients that have an endoscopy where no pathology is found are defined as having functional dyspepsia (FD). H. pylori eradication should be offered in these patients if they are infected. We recommend PPI, TCA and prokinetic therapy (in that order) in those that fail therapy or are H. pylori negative. We do not recommend routine upper gastrointestinal (GI) motility testing but it may be useful in selected patients."

Infection with H. pylori causes chronic inflammation and significantly increases the risk of developing duodenal and gastric ulcer disease and gastric cancer. Infection with H. pylori is the strongest known risk factor for gastric cancer, which is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Once H. pylori colonizes the gastric environment, it persists for the lifetime of the host, suggesting that the host immune response is ineffective in clearing this bacterium. In this review, we discuss the host immune response and examine other host factors that increase the pathogenic potential of this bacterium, including host polymorphisms, alterations to the apical-junctional complex, and the effects of environmental factors. In addition to host effects and responses, H. pylori strains are genetically diverse. We discuss the main virulence determinants in H. pylori strains and the correlation between these and the diverse clinical outcomes following H. pylori infection. Since H. pylori inhibits the gastric epithelium of half of the world, it is crucial that we continue to gain understanding of host and microbial factors that increase the risk of developing more severe clinical outcomes."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Baseline microbiological samples collected at one implant in each of participants with peri-implantitis and from individuals with a healthy implant were collected and analyzed by DNA-DNA checkerboard hybridization ( species). Clinical and radiographic data defined implant status. RESULTS: Nineteen bacterial species were found at higher counts from implants with peri-implantitis including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Helicobacter pylori, Haemophilus influenzae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Treponema socranskii (p < .).

It is also a puzzle of enormous medical importance given the incidence and lethality of gastric cancer worldwide. We review recent findings that have changed how we view these relationships and affected the direction of gastric cancer research. For example, recent data have indicated that subtle mismatches between host and microbe genetic traits greatly affect the risk of gastric cancer. The ability of H pylori and its oncoprotein CagA to reprogram epithelial cells and activate properties of stemness show the sophisticated relationship between H pylori and progenitor cells in the gastric mucosa. The observation that cell-associated H pylori can colonize the gastric glands and directly affect precursor and stem cells supports these observations. The ability to mimic these interactions in human gastric organoid cultures as well as animal models will allow investigators to more fully unravel the extent of H pylori control on the renewing gastric epithelium. Finally, our realization that external environmental factors, such as dietary components and essential micronutrients, as well as the gastrointestinal microbiota, can change the balance between H pylori's activity as a commensal or a pathogen has provided direction to studies aimed at defining the full carcinogenic potential of this organism."

During infection, bacteria are exposed to a host environment that is typically dominated by inflammatory cells and soluble factors, including antibiotics, which provide cues about regulation of gene expression. Bacterial adaptive changes including modulation of LPS synthesis and structure are a conserved theme in infections, irrespective of the type or bacteria or the site of infection. In general, these changes result in immune system evasion, persisting inflammation and increased antimicrobial resistance. Here, we review the modifications of LPS structure and biosynthetic pathways that occur upon adaptation of model opportunistic pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex bacteria, Helicobacter pylori and Salmonella enterica) to chronic infection in respiratory and gastrointestinal sites. We also discuss the molecular mechanisms of these variations and their role in the host-pathogen interaction."

Most of the many different techniques involved in diagnosis of H. pylori infection are performed in clinical microbiology laboratories. The aim of this article is to review the current status of these methods and their application, highlighting the important progress which has been made in the past decade.

The interplay of genetic susceptibility, lifestyle factors and infections in gallbladder carcinogenesis is still poorly understood. Age-adjusted rates were calculated by cancer registry-based data. Epidemiological studies on gallbladder cancer were selected through searches of literature, and relative risks were abstracted for major risk factors. The highest gallbladder cancer incidence rates worldwide were reported for women in Delhi, India (/,), South Karachi, Pakistan (/,) and Quito, Ecuador (/,). High incidence was found in Korea and Japan and some central and eastern European countries. Female-to-male incidence ratios were generally around , but ranged from in Far East Asia to over in Spain and Colombia. History of gallstones was the strongest risk factor for gallbladder cancer, with a pooled relative risk (RR) of [% confidence interval (CI): -]. Consistent associations were also present with obesity, multiparity and chronic infections like Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi [pooled RR (% CI: -)] and Helicobacter bilis and H. pylori [pooled RR (% CI: -)]. Differences in incidence ratios point to variations in gallbladder cancer aetiology in different populations. Diagnosis of gallstones and removal of gallbladder currently represent the keystone to gallbladder cancer prevention, but interventions able to prevent obesity, cholecystitis and gallstone formation should be assessed."

H. pylori-mediated upregulation of AID resulted in the accumulation of nucleotide alterations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene in gastric cells in vitro. Our findings provide evidence that aberrant AID expression caused by H. pylori infection might be a mechanism of mutation accumulation in the gastric mucosa during H. pylori-associated gastric carcinogenesis."

AIMS: We investigated the effects of an interleukin (IL-) gene polymorphism on the risk of gastroduodenal diseases, the degree of H pylori induced gastritis, and IL- gene transcription. SUBJECTS: The study was performed in healthy control subjects and H pylori positive patients with non-cardia gastric cancer, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, or gastritis. METHODS: We identified the IL- - A/T polymorphism by direct sequence analysis, and measured the gastritis score and serum pepsinogen (PG). The transcriptional promoter activity of the IL- gene was assessed by luciferase assay. RESULTS: IL- -251A was associated with a higher risk of gastric cancer and gastric ulcer. Patients carrying IL- -251A showed an increased risk of gastric cancer (odds ratios (OR) (% confidence interval (CI) -)) and gastric ulcer (OR (% CI -)). Compared with patients younger than years, atrophy and metaplasia scores in the antrum were significantly higher and the PG I/II ratio significantly lower in -251A carriers than in T/T carriers. In the in vitro assay, IL- -251A showed enhanced promoter activity in response to IL-1beta or tumour necrosis factor alpha. CONCLUSIONS: The IL- -251A allele may be associated with progression of gastric atrophy in patients with H pylori infection, and may increase the risk of gastric cancer and gastric ulcer in Japanese people."

Advances in our understanding of the migration patterns of early humans from Africa to populate the rest of the world obtained through the use of Y chromosome and mtDNA markers do much to inform this debate. There are clear examples of protection against infectious diseases from inheritance of polymorphisms in genes encoding and regulating the expression of ABH and Lewis antigens in bodily secretions particularly in respect of Helicobacter pylori, norovirus, and cholera infections. However, available evidence suggests surviving malaria is the most significant selective force affecting the expression of blood groups. Red cells lacking or having altered forms of blood group-active molecules are commonly found in regions of the world in which malaria is endemic, notably the Fy(a-b-) phenotype and the S-s- phenotype in Africa and the Ge- and SAO phenotypes in South East Asia. Founder effects provide a more convincing explanation for the distribution of the D- phenotype and the occurrence of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn in Europe and Central Asia."

The magnitude of benefit of H pylori eradication in populations with different levels of gastric cancer risk and in different clinical scenarios is unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies to investigate the effects of H pylori eradication on the incidence of gastric cancer. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov, reviewing titles and abstracts of studies of the effects of eradication of H pylori infection on risk of gastric cancer, through May . We also searched bibliographies of included studies, related reviews, and abstracts presented at Digestive Disease Week. Twenty-four eligible studies ( research manuscripts and abstracts) were included in our meta-analysis ( incident gastric cancers among a total of , individuals/, person-years). We assessed the effects, as well as their modification by baseline gastric cancer incidence, study design (randomized trial vs observational study), clinical scenario (asymptomatic infected individuals vs individuals after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer), demographic characteristics of patients (age and sex), and duration of follow-up. RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline gastric cancer incidence, individuals with eradication of H pylori infection had a lower incidence of gastric cancer than those who did not receive eradication therapy (pooled incidence rate ratio = ; % confidence interval: -). There was little heterogeneity among studies. Baseline gastric cancer incidence modified the benefit of H pylori eradication (P = . for interaction); the incidence rate ratio of gastric cancer decreased in a nonlinear fashion with increasing baseline incidence of gastric cancer (P = ., in comparison with the linear model). The benefit also modestly increased with age (P = . for interaction), but this might be due to correlation between age and baseline gastric cancer incidence. Eradication provided significant benefit for asymptomatic infected individuals (pooled incidence rate ratio, ; % CI: -) and individuals after endoscopic resection of gastric cancers (pooled incidence rate ratio, ; % CI: -). The benefits of H pylori eradication did not differ with study design, sex, or follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we associated eradication of H pylori infection with a reduced incidence of gastric cancer. The benefits of eradication vary with baseline gastric cancer incidence, but apply to all levels of baseline risk."

DESIGN: Twenty-three clinical questions addressing the above-mentioned four domains were drafted for which expert panels were asked to formulate relevant statements. A Delphi method using an anonymous electronic system was adopted to develop the consensus, the level of which was predefined as ≥%. Final modifications of clinical questions and consensus were achieved at the face-to-face meeting in Kyoto. RESULTS: All statements for clinical questions after extensive modifications and omission of one clinical question were achieved with a consensus level of >%. To better organise classification of gastritis and duodenitis based on aetiology, a new classification of gastritis and duodenitis is recommended for the 11th international classification. A new category of H. pylori-associated dyspepsia together with a diagnostic algorithm was proposed. The adoption of grading systems for gastric cancer risk stratification, and modern image-enhancing endoscopy for the diagnosis of gastritis, were recommended. Treatment to eradicate H. pylori infection before preneoplastic changes develop, if feasible, was recommended to minimise the risk of more serious complications of the infection.

The prevalence of gastric polyps in the EGD population was %; % were fundic gland polyps, % hyperplastic polyps/polypoid foveolar hyperplasia, % adenomas, and % inflammatory fibroid polyps. Malignant neoplasms were slightly >%. None of the benign gastric polyps had a significant positive association with concurrent H. pylori infection; intestinal metaplasia was detected in the background of % of carcinoids, % of adenomas, % of xanthomas, and % of adenocarcinomas and hyperplastic polyps. Adenomas were rarely associated with synchronous adenocarcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: The relative prevalence of fundic gland polyps in this population was much higher than that reported earlier, most likely because of the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors. H. pylori- and atrophy-associated polyps, including adenomas, were less common than in earlier series."

H. pylori is usually transmitted in childhood and persists for life if untreated. The infection affects around half of the population in the world but prevalence varies according to location and sanitation standards. H. pylori has unique properties to colonize gastric epithelium in an acidic environment. The pathophysiology of H. pylori infection is dependent on complex bacterial virulence mechanisms and their interaction with the host immune system and environmental factors, resulting in distinct gastritis phenotypes that determine possible progression to different gastroduodenal pathologies. The causative role of H. pylori infection in gastric cancer development presents the opportunity for preventive screen-and-treat strategies. Invasive, endoscopy-based and non-invasive methods, including breath, stool and serological tests, are used in the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. Their use depends on the specific individual patient history and local availability. H. pylori treatment consists of a strong acid suppressant in various combinations with antibiotics and/or bismuth. The dramatic increase in resistance to key antibiotics used in H. pylori eradication demands antibiotic susceptibility testing, surveillance of resistance and antibiotic stewardship."

Two important developments are associated with the decrease in rates of peptic ulcer disease: the discovery of effective and potent acid suppressants, and of Helicobacter pylori. With the discovery of H pylori infection, the causes, pathogenesis, and treatment of peptic ulcer disease have been rewritten. We focus on this revolution of understanding and management of peptic ulcer disease over the past years. Despite substantial advances, this disease remains an important clinical problem, largely because of the increasingly widespread use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and low-dose aspirin. We discuss the role of these agents in the causes of ulcer disease and therapeutic and preventive strategies for drug-induced ulcers. The rare but increasingly problematic H pylori-negative NSAID-negative ulcer is also examined."

We also investigated the effect of the IL- polymorphism on IL- production and histologic degree of gastritis in noncancerous gastric mucosa. Although no correlation was found in the analysis of the IL-1B and IL-1RN polymorphisms, IL- - A/A genotype held a higher risk of atrophic gastritis [odds ratio (OR), ; % confidence interval (CI), -] and gastric cancer (OR, ; % CI, -) compared with the T/T genotype.

In this study, we conducted a molecular investigation of pathogenic bacteria in feces from African nonhuman primates (NHPs). We also investigated the pathogens shared by the human population and gorillas living in the same territory in the Republic of Congo. In total, % of NHPs (n=) and % (n=) of humans were found to carry at least one bacterium. Non-pallidum Treponema spp. (including T. succinifaciens, T. berlinense, and several potential new species) were recovered from stools of % of great apes, % of monkeys, and % of humans. Non-tuberculosis Mycobacterium spp. were also common in almost all NHP species as well as in humans. In addition, Acinetobacter spp., members of the primate gut microbiota, were mainly prevalent in human and gorilla. Pathogenic Leptospira spp. were highly present in humans (%) and gorillas (%) stool samples in Congo, but were absent in the other NHPs, therefore suggesting a possible gorillas-humans exchange. Particular attention will be necessary for enteropathogenic bacteria detected in humans such as Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella spp. (including S. typhi/paratyphi), Staphyloccocus aureus, and Tropheryma whipplei, some of which were also present in gorillas in the same territory (S. aureus and T. whipplei). This study enhances our knowledge of pathogenic bacteria that threaten African NHPs and humans by using a non-invasive sampling technique. Contact between humans and NHPs results in an exchange of pathogens. Ongoing surveillance, prevention, and treatment strategies alone will limit the spread of these infectious agents."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A random sample (n =) of the adult population (- years of age) of two Swedish municipalities (n =,) was surveyed using a validated postal questionnaire assessing gastrointestinal symptoms. The response rate was %. A subsample (n = ) of the responders was subsequently invited, in random order, for esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy with evaluation of GERS, risk factors and tests for Helicobacter pylori. RESULTS: GERS were reported by % and EE was found in % of the population that had undergone endoscopy. Of those with GERS, % had EE while % of those with EE reported no GERS. Hiatus hernia and obesity remained significant risk factors for GERS and/or EE, with or without symptoms in a main effect model (OR up to at EE). Those with active H. pylori infection had a higher risk of GERS without EE than those without H. pylori infection (OR = ( )).

Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are preferable, but compassionate use reports and expert review articles are used in a thorough review of the literature conducted through Medline with the National Library of Medicine. Only when data that will not withstand objective scrutiny are available is a recommendation identified as a consensus of experts. Guidelines are applicable to all physicians who address the subject, without regard to specialty training or interests, and are intended to indicate the preferable, but not necessarily the only, acceptable approach to a specific problem. Guidelines are intended to be flexible and must be distinguished from standards of care, which are inflexible and rarely violated. Given the wide range of specifics in any health-care problem, the physician must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient and the variables in existence at the moment of decision. These guidelines were developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology by a committee of experts in the field, reviewed by its Practice Parameters Committee, and approved by the Board of Trustees. The recommendations of these guidelines are therefore considered valid at the time of production based on the data available. New developments in medical research and practice pertinent to each guideline will be reviewed at an established time and indicated at publication to assure continued validity. Owing to the volume of new data on the subject of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-related injury to the upper gastrointestinal tract, i.e., the advent of cyclooxygenase (COX)- inhibitors, new data on interactions between these agents, as well as traditional NSAIDs, with aspirin and H. pylori, it was elected by the Committee to confine these guidelines to upper gastrointestinal (GI) injury and to leave post-duodenal injury as the subject of a separate guideline."

We analyzed data on individuals aged > years and diabetes-free in -, whose blood was tested for antibodies to herpes simplex virus , varicella virus, cytomegalovirus, Helicobacter pylori, and Toxoplasma gondii and who were followed until June . We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the relative incidence rate of diabetes by serostatus, with adjustment for age, sex, education, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and cholesterol levels. RESULTS: Individuals seropositive for herpes simplex virus , varicella virus, cytomegalovirus, and T. gondii did not show an increased rate of diabetes, whereas those who were seropositive for H. pylori at enrollment were times more likely at any given time to develop diabetes than seronegative individuals (hazard ratio [% CI -]). Controlling for insulin resistance, C-reactive protein and interleukin- did not attenuate the effect of H. pylori infection. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated for the first time that H. pylori infection leads to an increased rate of incident diabetes in a prospective cohort study.

Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of a new, single-capsule treatment versus the gold standard for H pylori eradication. METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase trial in sites in Europe, comparing the efficacy and safety of days of quadruple therapy with omeprazole plus a single three-in-one capsule containing bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole, and tetracycline (quadruple therapy) versus days of omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (standard therapy) in adults with recorded H pylori infection. Patients were randomly assigned treatment according to a predetermined list independently generated by Quintiles Canada (Ville St-Laurent, QC, Canada). Our study was designed as a non-inferiority trial but was powered to detect superiority. Our primary outcome was H pylori eradication, established by two negative ()C urea breath tests at a minimum of and days after the end of treatment. Our assessment for non-inferiority was in the per-protocol population, with subsequent assessment for superiority in the intention-to-treat population (ie, all participants randomly assigned treatment). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00669955. FINDINGS: participants were lost to follow-up and were excluded from the per-protocol analysis. In the per-protocol population (n=), the lower bound of the CI for treatment with quadruple therapy was greater than the pre-established non-inferiority margin of -% (% CI ·-·; p<·). In the intention-to-treat population (n=), eradication rates were % ( of participants) in the quadruple therapy group versus % ( of ) in the standard therapy group (p<·). Safety profiles for both treatments were similar; main adverse events were gastrointestinal and CNS disorders. INTERPRETATION: Quadruple therapy should be considered for first-line treatment in view of the rising prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant H pylori, especially since quadruple therapy provides superior eradication with similar safety and tolerability to standard therapy.

We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to investigate this. METHODS: A comprehensive, English, multiple-source literature search was performed from to February . Only randomized controlled trial (RCT) and cohort studies comparing the prevalence of GERD in patients free from GERD at baseline with Hp eradication vs. those with persistent Hp were included. Quality of RCTs and cohorts was assessed by Jadad and New Castle-Ottawa scores, respectively. Meta-analysis of pooled odds ratios (ORs) was performed using Review Manager .. RESULTS: Twelve ( RCTs and cohorts) of articles were included. In six RCTs using erosive GERD as outcome, the OR for the frequency of GERD in Hp eradicated group vs. persistent Hp group was (-, P=). In five RCTs using symptomatic outcome, the OR for the frequency of GERD in Hp eradicated group vs. persistent Hp was (-, P=). In cohort studies, the OR for the frequency of GERD in Hp eradicated group vs. persistent Hp was (-; P=). Test of heterogeneity was not significant for any analyses. The results were consistent in subgroup and sensitivity analyses, including cohort studies vs. RCTs, high-quality studies vs. low-quality studies, and use of endoscopic vs. symptomatic outcomes except for the subgroup of patients with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in cohort studies (OR: (-); P=). CONCLUSIONS: There is no association between Hp eradication and development of new cases of GERD in the population of dyspeptic patients. However, in cohort studies, there seems to be a twofold higher risk of development of erosive GERD in patients with PUD. The effect in RCTs of patients with PUD did not show a significant difference."

The levels of C-reactive protein and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule- were significantly higher, and flow-mediated vasodilation was significantly lower in subjects with seropositive antibodies to HP than in subjects with seronegative antibodies to HP. Endothelium-independent vasodilation was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic infection with HP may be involved in the development of the atherosclerosis via endothelial dysfunction and systemic and vascular inflammation."

Probiotics could present a low-cost, large-scale alternative solution to prevent or decrease H. pylori colonization. A literature search of the MEDLINE database (-) has been performed selecting all in vitro, animal, and human fully published English-language studies dealing with H. pylori and probiotics. Probiotics had an in vitro inhibitory effect on H. pylori. Animal studies demonstrated that probiotic treatment is effective in reducing H. pylori-associated gastric inflammation. Seven of human studies showed an improvement of H. pylori gastritis and decrease in H. pylori density after administration of probiotics. The addition of probiotics to standard antibiotic treatment improved H. pylori eradication rates (% vs. %, with combination treatment vs. H. pylori-eradication treatment alone; chi()test: P=). Probiotic treatment reduced H. pylori therapy-associated side effects (incidence of side effects: % vs. %, with combination therapy vs. H. pylori-eradication treatment alone; chi()test: P=). No study could demonstrate the eradication of H. pylori infection by probiotic treatment. So long-term intake of products containing probiotic strains of probiotics may have a favorable effect on H. pylori infection in humans, particularly by reducing the risk of developing disorders associated with high degrees of gastric inflammation."

H. pylori is a major human pathogenic bacterium in gastric mucosa. To date, the role of miRNAs in response to H. pylori infection has not been explored. METHODS: The expression profile of cellular miRNAs during H. pylori infection was analyzed by using microarray and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The potential target of miR- was identified by luciferase assay and Western blot. Promoter analysis and inhibitor experiment were used to investigate the pathway involved in the induction of miR-. Examination of miR- function was performed by overexpression and inhibition of miR-. RESULTS: H. pylori was able to increase the miR- expression in gastric epithelial cell lines and gastric mucosal tissues, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein- (AP-) pathway were required for the induction of miR-. miR- may down-regulate IkappaB kinase epsilon, Sma- and Mad-related protein (SMAD2), and Fas-associated death domain protein. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR- negatively regulated the release of interleukin- and growth-related oncogene-alpha. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first description of increased expression of miR- in H. pylori infection, and miR- may function as novel negative regulator that help to fine-tune the inflammation response of H. pylori infection."

Here, using a novel differential approach (dRNA-seq) selective for the ' end of primary transcripts, we present a genome-wide map of H. pylori transcriptional start sites and operons. We discovered hundreds of transcriptional start sites within operons, and opposite to annotated genes, indicating that complexity of gene expression from the small H. pylori genome is increased by uncoupling of polycistrons and by genome-wide antisense transcription. We also discovered an unexpected number of approximately small RNAs including the epsilon-subdivision counterpart of the regulatory 6S RNA and associated RNA products, and potential regulators of cis- and trans-encoded target messenger RNAs.

METHODS: A foregut microbiome dataset was constructed using 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from oral, esophageal, and gastric microbiomes produced by Sanger sequencing in previous studies represented by bacterial species. Candidate primers evaluated were from the European rRNA database. To assess the effect of sequence length on accuracy of classification, 16S rRNA genes of various lengths were created by trimming the full length sequences. Sequences spanning various hypervariable regions were selected to simulate the amplicons that would be obtained using possible primer pairs. The sequences were compared with full length 16S rRNA genes for accuracy in taxonomic classification using online software at the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP). The universality of the primer set was evaluated using the RDP 16S rRNA database which is comprised of 16S rRNA genes, represented by phyla. RESULTS: Truncation to nucleotides (nt) downstream from the position corresponding to base in the Escherichia coli 16S rRNA gene caused misclassification of (%) of the sequences, compared with misclassification of only (%) sequences with truncation to nt. Among -nt sequence reads within various regions of the 16S rRNA gene, the reverse read of an amplicon generated using the 343F/798R primers had the least (%) effect on classification. In comparison, truncation to nt mimicking single pass Sanger reads misclassified % of the sequences. The 343F/798R amplicon accurately assigned % of the sequences at the species level. Weighted by abundance of the species in the esophageal dataset, the 343F/798R amplicon yielded similar classification accuracy without a significant loss in species coverage (%). Modification of the 343F/798R primers to 347F/803R increased their universality among foregut species. Assuming that a typical polymerase chain reaction can tolerate mismatches between a primer and a template, the modified 347F and 803R primers should be able to anneal % and % of all 16S rRNA genes in the RDP database. CONCLUSION: 347F/803R is the most suitable pair of primers for classification of foregut 16S rRNA genes but also possess universality suitable for analyses of other complex microbiomes."

Risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, family history of gastric cancer-in particular, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and pernicious anaemia. The stages in the progression to cancer include chronic gastritis, gastric atrophy (GA), gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) and dysplasia. The key to early detection of cancer and improved survival is to non-invasively identify those at risk before endoscopy. However, although biomarkers may help in the detection of patients with chronic atrophic gastritis, there is insufficient evidence to support their use for population screening. High-quality endoscopy with full mucosal visualisation is an important part of improving early detection. Image-enhanced endoscopy combined with biopsy sampling for histopathology is the best approach to detect and accurately risk-stratify GA and GIM. Biopsies following the Sydney protocol from the antrum, incisura, lesser and greater curvature allow both diagnostic confirmation and risk stratification for progression to cancer. Ideally biopsies should be directed to areas of GA or GIM visualised by high-quality endoscopy. There is insufficient evidence to support screening in a low-risk population (undergoing routine diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy) such as the UK, but endoscopic surveillance every years should be offered to patients with extensive GA or GIM. Endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection of visible gastric dysplasia and early cancer has been shown to be efficacious with a high success rate and low rate of recurrence, providing that specific quality criteria are met."

Most available trials have compared the different PPIs at one or a few selected specific dosages, making it difficult to derive quantitative equivalence dosages. Here we derived PPI dose equivalents based on a comprehensive assessment of dose-dependent effects on intragastric pH. METHODS: All available clinical studies reporting the effects of PPIs on mean -h intragastric pH were sought from electronic databases including Medline. Studies included were restricted to those targeting the Caucasian population, and healthy volunteers or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients. The dose-effect relationships for mean -h intragastric pH and for percentage of time with pH > in h were analyzed for each PPI using pharmacodynamic modeling with NONMEM and a model integrating all available data. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Based on the mean -h gastric pH, the relative potencies of the five PPIs compared to omeprazole were , , , , and for pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole, respectively. Compared with healthy volunteers, patients with GERD needed a -fold higher dose and Helicobacter pylori-positive individuals needed only about % of the dose to achieve a given increase in mean -h intragastric pH. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis provides quantitative estimates on clinical potency of individual PPIs that may be helpful when switching between PPIs and for assessing the cost-effectiveness of specific PPIs. However, our estimates must be viewed with caution because only a limited dose range has been tested and not exactly the same study conditions were applied for the different substances."

Addition in culture of HP-NAP, as an immune modulator, to antigen-induced T cell lines resulted in a remarkable increase in the number of IFN-gamma-producing T cells and decrease of IL--secreting cells, thus shifting the cytokine profile of antigen-activated human T cells from Th2 to a Th1 cytotoxic phenotype. We also found that in vivo HP-NAP elicited an antigen-specific Th1-polarized T cell response in the gastric mucosa of H. pylori-infected patients.

We propose that integrins are exploited by the gastric pathogen and type- carcinogen Helicobacter pylori for injection of the bacterial oncoprotein cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) into gastric epithelial cells. Virulent H. pylori express a type-IV secretion pilus that injects CagA into the host cell; CagA then becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src family kinases. However, the identity of the host cell receptor involved in this process has remained unknown. Here we show that the H. pylori CagL protein is a specialized adhesin that is targeted to the pilus surface, where it binds to and activates integrin alpha5beta1 receptor on gastric epithelial cells through an arginine-glycine-aspartate motif. This interaction triggers CagA delivery into target cells as well as activation of focal adhesion kinase and Src. Our findings provide insights into the role of integrins in H.-pylori-induced pathogenesis. CagL may be exploited as a new molecular tool for our further understanding of integrin signalling."

Their inhibition is exploited clinically for decades for various classes of diuretics and systemically acting antiglaucoma agents. In the last years novel applications of CA inhibitors (CAIs) emerged, such as topically acting antiglaucoma, anticonvulsants, antiobesity, antipain, and antitumor agents/diagnostic tools. Such CAIs target diverse isozymes of the catalytically active alpha-CA isoforms present in mammals. CAs belonging to the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, and zeta-families are found in many organisms all over the phylogenetic tree, and their inhibition was studied ultimately for some pathogenic protozoa (Plasmodium falciparum), fungi (Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and bacteria (Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Brucella suis). Novel interesting chemotypes, in addition to the sulfonamide and sulfamate CAIs, such as coumarins, phenols, and fullerenes, were also reported recently, together with their mechanism of inhibition.

H. pylori strains that express the vacuolating cytotoxin or the outer membrane protein OipA are similarly associated with severe pathologic outcomes. We previously reported that an in vivo adapted H. pylori strain, , induces gastric adenocarcinoma in rodent models of gastritis. In the current study, we used carcinogenic strain as a prototype to define the role of virulence constituents in H. pylori-mediated carcinogenesis. Mongolian gerbils were infected with wild-type strain or cagA(-), vacA(-), or oipA(-) mutants for to weeks. All infected gerbils developed gastritis; however, inflammation was significantly attenuated in animals infected with the cagA(-) but not the vacA(-) or oipA(-) strains. Gastric dysplasia and cancer developed in >% of gerbils infected with either the wild-type or vacA(-) strain but in none of the animals infected with the cagA(-) strain. Inactivation of oipA decreased beta-catenin nuclear localization in vitro and reduced the incidence of cancer in gerbils. OipA expression was detected significantly more frequently among H. pylori strains isolated from human subjects with gastric cancer precursor lesions versus persons with gastritis alone. These results indicate that loss of CagA prevents the development of cancer in this model.

In addition to defining factors that mediate H. pylori-induced cancer, these results provide insight into mechanisms that may regulate the development of other malignancies arising within the context of inflammatory states."

We performed an umbrella review of meta-analyses to summarize available epidemiologic evidence and assess its credibility. METHODS: We systematically identified and appraised meta-analyses of observational studies examining environmental factors and risk of IBD (Crohn's disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis [UC]). For each meta-analysis, we considered the random effects estimate, its % confidence interval, the estimates of heterogeneity, and small-study effects, and we graded the evidence according to prespecified criteria. Methodologic quality was assessed with AMSTAR (ie, A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) . RESULTS: We examined estimates in meta-analyses of environmental factors related to lifestyles and hygiene, surgeries, drug exposures, diet, microorganisms, and vaccinations. We identified factors that increase risk of IBD: smoking (CD), urban living (CD and IBD), appendectomy (CD), tonsillectomy (CD), antibiotic exposure (IBD), oral contraceptive use (IBD), consumption of soft drinks (UC), vitamin D deficiency (IBD), and non-Helicobacter pylori-like enterohepatic Helicobacter species (IBD). We identified factors that reduce risk of IBD: physical activity (CD), breastfeeding (IBD), bed sharing (CD), tea consumption (UC), high levels of folate (IBD), high levels of vitamin D (CD), and H pylori infection (CD, UC, and IBD). Epidemiologic evidence for all of these associations was of high to moderate strength; we identified another factors associated with increased risk and factors associated with reduced risk with weak credibility. Methodologic quality varied considerably among meta-analyses. Several associations were based on findings from retrospective studies, so it is not possible to determine if these are effects of IBD or the results of recall bias. CONCLUSIONS: In an umbrella review of meta-analyses, we found varying levels of evidence for associations of different environmental factors with risk of IBD. High-quality prospective studies with analyses of samples from patients with recent diagnoses of IBD are needed to determine whether these factors cause or are results of IBD and their pathogenic mechanisms."

Some populations that have a high prevalence of H. pylori infection also have a high incidence of gastric cancer (for example, in East Asia), whereas others do not (for example, in Africa and South Asia). Even within East Asia, the incidence of gastric cancer varies (decreasing in the south). H. pylori is a highly heterogeneous bacterium and its virulence varies geographically. Geographic differences in the incidence of gastric cancer can be explained, at least in part, by the presence of different types of H. pylori virulence factor, especially CagA, VacA and OipA. However, it is still unclear why the pathogenicity of H. pylori increased as it migrated from Africa to East Asia during the course of evolution. H. pylori infection is also thought to be involved in the development of duodenal ulcer, which is at the opposite end of the disease spectrum to gastric cancer. This discrepancy can be explained in part by the presence of H. pylori virulence factor DupA. Despite advances in our understanding of the development of H. pylori-related diseases, further work is required to clarify the roles of H. pylori virulence factors."

H. pylori survives in acidic conditions by producing urease, which catalyzes hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia thus elevating the pH of its environment. However, the manner in which H. pylori is able to swim through the viscoelastic mucus gel that coats the stomach wall remains poorly understood. Previous rheology studies on gastric mucin, the key viscoelastic component of gastric mucus, indicate that the rheology of this material is pH dependent, transitioning from a viscous solution at neutral pH to a gel in acidic conditions. Bulk rheology measurements on porcine gastric mucin (PGM) show that pH elevation by H. pylori induces a dramatic decrease in viscoelastic moduli. Microscopy studies of the motility of H. pylori in gastric mucin at acidic and neutral pH in the absence of urea show that the bacteria swim freely at high pH, and are strongly constrained at low pH. By using two-photon fluorescence microscopy to image the bacterial motility in an initially low pH mucin gel with urea present we show that the gain of translational motility by bacteria is directly correlated with a rise in pH indicated by ','-Bis-(-Carboxyethyl)--(and-)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), a pH sensitive fluorescent dye. This study indicates that the helicoidal-shaped H. pylori does not bore its way through the mucus gel like a screw through a cork as has previously been suggested, but instead achieves motility by altering the rheological properties of its environment."

Even though GroEL proteins are classically considered intracellular proteins, they have been found at the surface of several mucosal pathogens and have been implicated in cell attachment and immune modulation. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the GroEL protein of a gram-positive probiotic bacterium, Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 (NCC ). Its presence at the bacterial surface was demonstrated using a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and could be detected in bacterial spent culture medium by immunoblotting. To assess binding of La1 GroEL to mucins and intestinal epithelial cells, the La1 GroEL protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. We report here that La1 recombinant GroEL (rGroEL) binds to mucins and epithelial cells and that this binding is pH dependent. Immunomodulation studies showed that La1 rGroEL stimulates interleukin- secretion in macrophages and HT29 cells in a CD14-dependent mechanism. This property is common to rGroEL from other gram-positive bacteria but not to the rGroEL of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. In addition, La1 rGroEL mediates the aggregation of H. pylori but not that of other intestinal pathogens. Our in vitro results suggest that GroEL proteins from La1 and other lactic acid bacteria might play a role in gastrointestinal homeostasis due to their ability to bind to components of the gastrointestinal mucosa and to aggregate H. pylori."

The factors predisposing patients to marginal ulceration are still unclear. METHODS: A total of patients who underwent laparoscopic RYGB were retrospectively reviewed. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), Helicobacter pylori infection, gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomotic leaks, postoperative bleeding, operative time, type of suture material, and marginal ulcer formation were collected. Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analysis of discrete variables, and Student's t-test was used for continuous variables. Statistical significance was set at an alpha of . RESULTS: The overall marginal ulceration rate was %. Demographic data (age, gender distribution, BMI) did not differ significantly between patients who experienced marginal ulceration and those who did not (p > ). Similarly, technical factors (choice of permanent or absorbable suture for the GJ anastomosis, attending as primary surgeon, robotic GJ, operative time, postoperative hematocrit drop) were not statistically different between the two groups (p > ). Finally, the prevalence of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, musculoskeletal complaints, dyslipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD] and peptic ulcer disease [PUD]) did not differ significantly between the two groups (p > ). However, preoperative H. pylori infection, although adequately treated, was twice as common among the patients who had marginal ulceration (%) as among those who did not (%) (p = ). All the patients who experienced marginal ulcers had complete resolution of symptoms with proton pump inhibitors and sucralfate. No reoperations were required for marginal ulceration. CONCLUSION: Helicobacter pylori may potentiate marginal ulcer formation. The authors hypothesize that H. pylori damages the mucosal barrier in a way that persists postoperatively, which may precipitate marginal ulceration even when the organism has been medically eradicated."

Our aim was to study the association between H. pylori-positive gastritis and the occurrence of any colonic neoplasm. METHODS: From a computerized database of surgical pathology reports, we selected , subjects who underwent colonoscopy and esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy with biopsy results from both procedures. RESULTS: Compared with normal gastric mucosa, H. pylori gastritis occurred more frequently among patients with hyperplastic polyps (OR=, % CI: -), adenomatous polyps (, -), advanced adenomas (, -), villous adenomas or adenomas with high-grade dysplasia (, -), and adenocarcinomas (, -). Similarly, the strength of the association between H. pylori-positive gastritis and colonic neoplasm increased with size and number of the adenomas. The association between H. pylori gastritis and the occurrence of colonic neoplasm was similar for different locations of the large bowel. Other gastric conditions etiologically associated with H. pylori, such as intestinal metaplasia, adenoma, lymphoma, and adenocarcinoma, were also significantly associated with an increased risk of colonic neoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: Various forms of gastritis related to H. pylori infection confer an increased risk for colonic neoplasm. In the past, when H. pylori infection was more prevalent, its attributable risk to the occurrence of colorectal neoplasm may have been quite substantial."

Numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of L. casei or the L. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as Escherichia coli strain Nissle , certain enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) and the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. Among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are basic mechanisms. They are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. In addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. Well-established probiotic effects are: . Prevention and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. . Reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. . Prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. . Beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, Helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. . Normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. . Prevention or alleviation of allergies and atopic diseases in infants. . Prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. Insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). A prebiotic is ""a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health"", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. Today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for prebiotic classification. They are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. Other health effects of prebiotics (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect, i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. In the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides."

More than % of all time series expression datasets are short ( time points or fewer). These datasets present unique challenges. On account of the large number of genes profiled (often tens of thousands) and the small number of time points many patterns are expected to arise at random. Most clustering algorithms are unable to distinguish between real and random patterns. RESULTS: We present an algorithm specifically designed for clustering short time series expression data. Our algorithm works by assigning genes to a predefined set of model profiles that capture the potential distinct patterns that can be expected from the experiment. We discuss how to obtain such a set of profiles and how to determine the significance of each of these profiles. Significant profiles are retained for further analysis and can be combined to form clusters. We tested our method on both simulated and real biological data. Using immune response data we show that our algorithm can correctly detect the temporal profile of relevant functional categories. Using Gene Ontology analysis we show that our algorithm outperforms both general clustering algorithms and algorithms designed specifically for clustering time series gene expression data.

Unless treated, colonization usually persists lifelong. H. pylori infection represents a key factor in the etiology of various gastrointestinal diseases, ranging from chronic active gastritis without clinical symptoms to peptic ulceration, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Disease outcome is the result of the complex interplay between the host and the bacterium. Host immune gene polymorphisms and gastric acid secretion largely determine the bacterium's ability to colonize a specific gastric niche. Bacterial virulence factors such as the cytotoxin-associated gene pathogenicity island-encoded protein CagA and the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA aid in this colonization of the gastric mucosa and subsequently seem to modulate the host's immune system. This review focuses on the microbiological, clinical, immunological, and biochemical aspects of the pathogenesis of H. pylori."

Clinical prediction rules are used, but accuracy varies with study population. Early surgery, either by laparoscopic or open repair, and proper sepsis management are essential for good outcome. Selected patients can be managed non-operatively or with novel endoscopic approaches, but validation of such methods in trials is needed. Quality of care, sepsis care bundles, and postoperative monitoring need further assessment. Adequate trials with low risk of bias are urgently needed to provide better evidence.

This difference reached statistical significance and heterogeneity markedly decreased when a single outlier study was excluded or when only high-quality studies were considered. Meta-analysis showed less adverse effects with levofloxacin than with quadruple regimen, both overall (% vs. %; OR = ; % CI = -) and regarding severe adverse effects (% vs. %; OR = ; % CI =-). CONCLUSIONS: After H. pylori eradication failure, levofloxacin-based rescue regimen is more effective and better tolerated than the generally recommended quadruple therapy. A -day combination of levofloxacin-amoxicillin-proton pump inhibitor constitutes an encouraging second-line alternative."

Graphene is capable of highly sensitive analyte detection due to its nanoscale nature. Here we show that graphene can be printed onto water-soluble silk. This in turn permits intimate biotransfer of graphene nanosensors onto biomaterials, including tooth enamel. The result is a fully biointerfaced sensing platform, which can be tuned to detect target analytes. For example, via self-assembly of antimicrobial peptides onto graphene, we show bioselective detection of bacteria at single-cell levels. Incorporation of a resonant coil eliminates the need for onboard power and external connections. Combining these elements yields two-tiered interfacing of peptide-graphene nanosensors with biomaterials. In particular, we demonstrate integration onto a tooth for remote monitoring of respiration and bacteria detection in saliva. Overall, this strategy of interfacing graphene nanosensors with biomaterials represents a versatile approach for ubiquitous detection of biochemical targets."

Sporadic AD is a complex multifactorial neurodegenerative disease with evidence indicating coexisting multi-pathogen and inflammatory etiologies. There are significant associations between AD and various pathogens, including Herpes simplex virus type (HSV-), Cytomegalovirus, and other Herpesviridae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, spirochetes, Helicobacter pylori, and various periodontal pathogens. These pathogens are able to evade destruction by the host immune system, leading to persistent infection. Bacterial and viral DNA and RNA and bacterial ligands increase the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules and activate the innate and adaptive immune systems. Evidence demonstrates that pathogens directly and indirectly induce AD pathology, including amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation, phosphorylation of tau protein, neuronal injury, and apoptosis. Chronic brain infection with HSV-, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and spirochetes results in complex processes that interact to cause a vicious cycle of uncontrolled neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Infections such as Cytomegalovirus, Helicobacter pylori, and periodontal pathogens induce production of systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines that may cross the blood-brain barrier to promote neurodegeneration. Pathogen-induced inflammation and central nervous system accumulation of Aβ damages the blood-brain barrier, which contributes to the pathophysiology of AD. Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) enhances brain infiltration by pathogens including HSV- and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. ApoE4 is also associated with an increased pro-inflammatory response by the immune system. Potential antimicrobial treatments for AD are discussed, including the rationale for antiviral and antibiotic clinical trials."

DESIGN: We performed 16S rRNA gene analysis of gastric mucosal samples from cases including superficial gastritis (SG), atrophic gastritis (AG), intestinal metaplasia (IM) and gastric cancer (GC) from Xi'an, China, to determine mucosal microbiome dysbiosis across stages of GC. We validated the results in mucosal samples of cases from Inner Mongolia, China. RESULTS: We observed significant mucosa microbial dysbiosis in IM and GC subjects, with significant enrichment of and depletion of bacterial taxa in GC compared with SG (q<). Microbial network analysis showed increasing correlation strengths among them with disease progression (p<). Five GC-enriched bacterial taxa whose species identifications correspond to Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Streptococcus anginosus, Parvimonas micra, Slackia exigua and Dialister pneumosintes had significant centralities in the GC ecological network (p<) and classified GC from SG with an area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of . Moreover, stronger interactions among gastric microbes were observed in Helicobacter pylori-negative samples compared with H. pylori-positive samples in SG and IM. The fold changes of selected bacteria, and strengths of their interactions were successfully validated in the Inner Mongolian cohort, in which the five bacterial markers distinguished GC from SG with an AUC of . CONCLUSIONS: In addition to microbial compositional changes, we identified differences in bacterial interactions across stages of gastric carcinogenesis. The significant enrichments and network centralities suggest potentially important roles of P. stomatis, D. pneumosintes, S. exigua, P. micra and S. anginosus in GC progression."

In the present study, we analyzed the ability of H. pylori strains to form biofilms and characterized the underlying mechanisms of H. pylori biofilm formation. RESULTS: Strain TK1402 showed strong biofilm forming ability relative to the other strains in Brucella broth supplemented with % FCS. The strong biofilm forming ability of TK1402 is reflected the relative thickness of the biofilms. In addition, outer membrane vesicles (OMV) were detected within the matrix of only the TK1402 biofilms. Biofilm formation was strongly correlated with the production of OMV in this strain. We further observed that strain TK1402 did not form thick biofilms in Brucella broth supplemented with % beta-cyclodextrin. However, the addition of the OMV-fraction collected from TK1402 could enhance biofilm formation. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that OMV produced from TK1402 play an important role in biofilm formation in strain TK1402."

METHODS: We reviewed clinical documentation and samples from separate GI biopsy or resection sites on CVID patients obtained over a -year period, including biopsies from the colon (), esophagus (), small intestine (), and stomach (), a partial gastrectomy, small bowel resection, colectomy, cholecystectomies, and appendectomy. RESULTS: There were males and females. Nine patients were children ( y and younger) and were adults. Age at diagnosis ranged from months to years (median, y), and age at biopsy ranged from months to years (median, y). Esophageal samples often showed intraepithelial neutrophils, accompanied by candida. Half of patients' esophageal biopsies had prominent intraepithelial lymphocytosis, one of which also had prominent apoptosis. The stomachs of % of patients lacked plasma cells. Most showed lymphoid aggregates. An increase in apoptosis was detected in biopsies from a third. About % had a lymphocytic gastritis pattern. Intraepithelial neutrophils were found in a subset, accompanied by various infections [cytomegalovirus (CMV), Helicobacter pylori, and Cryptosporidium]. Granulomas were found in patient. Gastric adenocarcinoma was identified in one patient. There was a paucity of small bowel plasma cells in the majority of patients (%). The small bowel showed prominent lymphoid aggregates in about half (%). An increase in apoptosis was detected in specimens from about %. Increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were found in samples from over half of patients (%), most of whom (%) also had villous blunting, mimicking celiac disease. Intraepithelial neutrophils were found in a subset (%) and correlated with CMV and Cryptosporidium infections. Granulomas were seen in biopsies from patients (%). One patient had a collagenous enteritis pattern (accompanied by a collagenous colitis pattern). One patient had autoimmune enteritis; biopsies from this patient were initially relatively normal but later displayed prominent crypt apoptosis and loss of goblet cells. In colon samples, a paucity of plasma cells was seen in patients (%). The colon showed lymphoid aggregates in most patients (%). Apoptosis was prominent in samples from half of the patients (%). Biopsies from patients had a lymphocytic colitis pattern (%) and patients had a collagenous colitis pattern. Intraepithelial neutrophils were found in samples from most patients (%). Crypt distortion was seen in of these patients (%), thereby mimicking ulcerative or Crohn colitis. Granulomas were found in patients (%). CMV was detected in patient. The appendix from patient showed Cryptosporidium and acute serositis with a paucity of plasma cells and an increase in apoptosis. The gallbladder from patient showed acute cholecystitis, and another patient's gallbladder lacked plasma cells. CONCLUSIONS: GI tract CVID displays a wide spectrum of histologic patterns. Its features can mimic lymphocytic colitis, collagenous enterocolitis, celiac disease, lymphocytic gastritis, granulomatous disease, acute graft-versus-host disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. In fact, in our series, we found patients with a prior diagnosis of celiac disease (%) and inflammatory bowel disease (%), including Crohn disease (%). The diagnosis of CVID may be suspected on the basis of the lack of plasma cells in a GI biopsy, but because this feature is only present in about two-thirds of patients, the diagnosis cannot always be suggested in isolation of other clinical and laboratory findings."

Polymedication and genetic polymorphisms modulating drug-metabolising enzyme activities (cytochromes P450, CYP) are identified sources of variability in drug responses. We present here the relevant data on the clinical impact of the major CYP polymorphisms (CYP2D6, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9) on drug therapy where genotyping and phenotyping may be considered, and the guidelines developed when available. CYP2D6 is responsible for the oxidative metabolism of up to % of commonly prescribed drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, opioids, antiarrythmics and tamoxifen. The ultrarapid metaboliser (UM) phenotype is recognised as a cause of therapeutic inefficacy of antidepressant, whereas an increased risk of toxicity has been reported in poor metabolisers (PMs) with several psychotropics (desipramine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline, haloperidol). CYP2D6 polymorphism influences the analgesic response to prodrug opioids (codeine, tramadol and oxycodone). In PMs for CYP2D6, reduced analgesic effects have been observed, whereas in UMs cases of life-threatening toxicity have been reported with tramadol and codeine. CYP2D6 PM phenotype has been associated with an increased risk of toxicity of metoprolol, timolol, carvedilol and propafenone. Although conflicting results have been reported regarding the association between CYP2D6 genotype and tamoxifen effects, CYP2D6 genotyping may be useful in selecting adjuvant hormonal therapy in postmenopausal women. CYP2C19 is responsible for metabolising clopidogrel, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and some antidepressants. Carriers of CYP2C19 variant alleles exhibit a reduced capacity to produce the active metabolite of clopidogrel, and are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. For PPIs, it has been shown that the mean intragastric pH values and the Helicobacter pylori eradication rates were higher in carriers of CYP2C19 variant alleles. CYP2C19 is involved in the metabolism of several antidepressants. As a result of an increased risk of adverse effects in CYP2C19 PMs, dose reductions are recommended for some agents (imipramine, sertraline). CYP2C9 is responsible for metabolising vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sulfonylureas, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and phenytoin. For VKAs, CYP2C9 polymorphism has been associated with lower doses, longer time to reach treatment stability and higher frequencies of supratherapeutic international normalised ratios (INRs). Prescribing algorithms are available in order to adapt dosing to genotype. Although the existing data are controversial, some studies have suggested an increased risk of NSAID-associated gastrointestinal bleeding in carriers of CYP2C9 variant alleles. A relationship between CYP2C9 polymorphisms and the pharmacokinetics of sulfonylureas and angiotensin II receptor antagonists has also been observed. The clinical impact in terms of hypoglycaemia and blood pressure was, however, modest. Finally, homozygous and heterozygous carriers of CYP2C9 variant alleles require lower doses of phenytoin to reach therapeutic plasma concentrations, and are at increased risk of toxicity. New diagnostic techniques made safer and easier should allow quicker diagnosis of metabolic variations. Genotyping and phenotyping may therefore be considered where dosing guidelines according to CYP genotype have been published, and help identify the right molecule for the right patient."

The increase in asthma rates has been linked epidemiologically to the rapid disappearance of Helicobacter pylori, a bacterial pathogen that persistently colonizes the human stomach, from Western societies. In this study, we have utilized mouse models of allergic airway disease induced by ovalbumin or house dust mite allergen to experimentally examine a possible inverse correlation between H. pylori and asthma. H. pylori infection efficiently protected mice from airway hyperresponsiveness, tissue inflammation, and goblet cell metaplasia, which are hallmarks of asthma, and prevented allergen-induced pulmonary and bronchoalveolar infiltration with eosinophils, Th2 cells, and Th17 cells. Protection against asthma was most robust in mice infected neonatally and was abrogated by antibiotic eradication of H. pylori. Asthma protection was further associated with impaired maturation of lung-infiltrating dendritic cells and the accumulation of highly suppressive Tregs in the lungs. Systemic Treg depletion abolished asthma protection; conversely, the adoptive transfer of purified Treg populations was sufficient to transfer protection from infected donor mice to uninfected recipients. Our results thus provide experimental evidence for a beneficial effect of H. pylori colonization on the development of allergen-induced asthma."

To date, clinical guidance for best practices related to the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis remains very limited in the United States, which leads to poor recognition of this preneoplastic condition and suboptimal risk stratification. In addition, there is heterogeneity in the definitions of atrophic gastritis, autoimmune gastritis, pernicious anemia, and gastric neoplasia in the literature, which has led to confusion in clinical practice and research. Accordingly, the primary objective of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide clinicians with a framework for the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis. By focusing on atrophic gastritis, this Clinical Practice Update is intended to complement the American Gastroenterological Association Institute guidelines on the management of gastric intestinal metaplasia. These recent guidelines did not specifically discuss the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis. Providers should recognize, however, that a diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histopathology implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis because intestinal metaplasia occurs in underlying atrophic mucosa, although this is often not distinctly noted on histopathologic reports. Nevertheless, atrophic gastritis represents an important stage with distinct histopathologic alterations in the multistep cascade of gastric cancer pathogenesis. METHODS: The Best Practice Advice statements presented herein were developed from a combination of available evidence from published literature and consensus-based expert opinion. No formal rating of the strength or quality of the evidence was carried out. These statements are meant to provide practical advice to clinicians practicing in the United States. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE : Atrophic gastritis is defined as the loss of gastric glands, with or without metaplasia, in the setting of chronic inflammation mainly due to Helicobacter pylori infection or autoimmunity. Regardless of the etiology, the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis should be confirmed by histopathology. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE : Providers should be aware that the presence of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histology almost invariably implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis. There should be a coordinated effort between gastroenterologists and pathologists to improve the consistency of documenting the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis, particularly if marked atrophy is present. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE : Providers should recognize typical endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis, which include pale appearance of gastric mucosa, increased visibility of vasculature due to thinning of the gastric mucosa, and loss of gastric folds, and, if with concomitant intestinal metaplasia, light blue crests and white opaque fields. Because these mucosal changes are often subtle, techniques to optimize evaluation of the gastric mucosa should be performed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE : When endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis are present, providers should assess the extent endoscopically. Providers should obtain biopsies from the suspected atrophic/metaplastic areas for histopathological confirmation and risk stratification; at a minimum, biopsies from the body and antrum/incisura should be obtained and placed in separately labeled jars. Targeted biopsies should additionally be obtained from any other mucosal abnormalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE : In patients with histology compatible with autoimmune gastritis, providers should consider checking antiparietal cell antibodies and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies to assist with the diagnosis. Providers should also evaluate for anemia due to vitamin B- and iron deficiencies. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE : All individuals with atrophic gastritis should be assessed for H pylori infection. If positive, treatment of H pylori should be administered and successful eradication should be confirmed using nonserological testing modalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE : The optimal endoscopic surveillance interval for patients with atrophic gastritis is not well-defined and should be decided based on individual risk assessment and shared decision making. A surveillance endoscopy every years should be considered in individuals with advanced atrophic gastritis, defined based on anatomic extent and histologic grade. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE : The optimal surveillance interval for individuals with autoimmune gastritis is unclear. Interval endoscopic surveillance should be considered based on individualized assessment and shared decision making. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE : Providers should recognize pernicious anemia as a late-stage manifestation of autoimmune gastritis that is characterized by vitamin B- deficiency and macrocytic anemia. Patients with a new diagnosis of pernicious anemia who have not had a recent endoscopy should undergo endoscopy with topographical biopsies to confirm corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis for risk stratification and to rule out prevalent gastric neoplasia, including neuroendocrine tumors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE : Individuals with autoimmune gastritis should be screened for type gastric neuroendocrine tumors with upper endoscopy. Small neuroendocrine tumors should be removed endoscopically, followed by surveillance endoscopy every - years, depending on the burden of neuroendocrine tumors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE : Providers should evaluate for iron and vitamin B- deficiencies in patients with atrophic gastritis irrespective of etiology, especially if corpus-predominant. Likewise, in patients with unexplained iron or vitamin B- deficiency, atrophic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic evaluation pursued. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE : In patients with autoimmune gastritis, providers should recognize that concomitant autoimmune disorders, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, are common. Screening for autoimmune thyroid disease should be performed."

This meta-analysis included studies that encompassed a total of patients. The frequency of EBVaGC was %, and EBVaGC was significantly associated with ethnicity. It was more predominant in men and in younger individuals. Interestingly, EBVaGC was more prevalent in Caucasian and Hispanic patients than in Asian ones. EBVaGC developed most often in the cardia and body, and it generally showed the diffuse histological type. EBV was highly prevalent in the patients with lymphoepithelial carcinoma. EBVaGC was closely associated with remnant cancer and a CpG island methylator-high status, but not with Helicobacter pylori infection, a TP53 expression, and p53 mutation. In addition, EBVaGC was not significantly associated with the depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, or the clinical stage.

Both the aetiology and pathogenesis of HG remain unknown. We conducted a literature review (-now) to summarize the current evidence on the aetiology and pathogenesis of HG. The potential role of pregnancy-related hormones such as progesterone, estrogen and HCG has been widely studied; however, various other hormones such as leptin, placental growth hormone, prolactin, thyroid and adrenal cortical hormones have been implicated in the aetiology of HG. In addition to endocrinological hypotheses, the rationale and evidence considering infectious, immunological, psychological, metabolic and anatomical causes for HG have been analysed here. Many studies suffer from the low number of patients included, the variable definition used for HG and varying assay methodology used in studies of hormone measurement. This review highlights the need for more extensive studies addressing the pathogenesis and aetiology of HG."

The aim was the evaluation of Hp infection in patients with NAFLD and its association with disease severity. METHODS: patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD ( with simple nonalcoholic fatty liver [NAFL], with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]) and matched healthy controls were recruited. Blood samples for anti-Hp Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and standard biochemical tests were obtained after overnight fasting, and ()C urea breath test was performed before liver biopsy in NAFLD group. RESULTS: Higher rates of anti-Hp IgG (P=.) were observed in NAFLD compared to control group. Only two NAFLD patients neither were Hp IgG seropositive nor did they have a history of eradication treatment compared to control subjects (P=.). Both Hp infection (assessed by history of Hp eradication treatment and/or Hp IgG seropositivity) (P=.) and log(HOMA-IR) (P=.) could independently predict NAFLD in logistic regression analysis. There were similar rates of Hp IgG seropositivity or positivity in ()C urea breath test or their combination between NAFL and NASH patients. There were no significant differences in steatosis grade, fibrosis stage, lobular or portal inflammation, or ballooning, when NAFLD patients were divided according to Hp IgG seropositivity or ()C urea breath test positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Hp infection may represent one more hit contributing to the pathogenesis of NAFL, though not to the progression from NAFL to NASH. These results warrant further validation. If confirmed, eradicating Hp infection may have certain therapeutic perspectives in NAFLD treatment."

It addresses the diagnosis and management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (NVUGIH). Main Recommendations MR1. ESGE recommends immediate assessment of hemodynamic status in patients who present with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH), with prompt intravascular volume replacement initially using crystalloid fluids if hemodynamic instability exists (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR2. ESGE recommends a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy that aims for a target hemoglobin between g/dL and g/dL. A higher target hemoglobin should be considered in patients with significant co-morbidity (e. g., ischemic cardiovascular disease) (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR3. ESGE recommends the use of the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) for pre-endoscopy risk stratification. Outpatients determined to be at very low risk, based upon a GBS score of - , do not require early endoscopy nor hospital admission. Discharged patients should be informed of the risk of recurrent bleeding and be advised to maintain contact with the discharging hospital (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR4. ESGE recommends initiating high dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI), intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion ( mg then mg/hour), in patients presenting with acute UGIH awaiting upper endoscopy. However, PPI infusion should not delay the performance of early endoscopy (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR5. ESGE does not recommend the routine use of nasogastric or orogastric aspiration/lavage in patients presenting with acute UGIH (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR6. ESGE recommends intravenous erythromycin (single dose, mg given - minutes prior to upper gastrointestinal [GI] endoscopy) in patients with clinically severe or ongoing active UGIH. In selected patients, pre-endoscopic infusion of erythromycin significantly improves endoscopic visualization, reduces the need for second-look endoscopy, decreases the number of units of blood transfused, and reduces duration of hospital stay (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR7. Following hemodynamic resuscitation, ESGE recommends early (≤ hours) upper GI endoscopy. Very early (< hours) upper GI endoscopy may be considered in patients with high risk clinical features, namely: hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension) that persists despite ongoing attempts at volume resuscitation; in-hospital bloody emesis/nasogastric aspirate; or contraindication to the interruption of anticoagulation (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR8. ESGE recommends that peptic ulcers with spurting or oozing bleeding (Forrest classification Ia and Ib, respectively) or with a nonbleeding visible vessel (Forrest classification IIa) receive endoscopic hemostasis because these lesions are at high risk for persistent bleeding or rebleeding (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR9. ESGE recommends that peptic ulcers with an adherent clot (Forrest classification IIb) be considered for endoscopic clot removal. Once the clot is removed, any identified underlying active bleeding (Forrest classification Ia or Ib) or nonbleeding visible vessel (Forrest classification IIa) should receive endoscopic hemostasis (weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR10. In patients with peptic ulcers having a flat pigmented spot (Forrest classification IIc) or clean base (Forrest classification III), ESGE does not recommend endoscopic hemostasis as these stigmata present a low risk of recurrent bleeding. In selected clinical settings, these patients may be discharged to home on standard PPI therapy, e. g., oral PPI once-daily (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR11. ESGE recommends that epinephrine injection therapy not be used as endoscopic monotherapy. If used, it should be combined with a second endoscopic hemostasis modality (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR12. ESGE recommends PPI therapy for patients who receive endoscopic hemostasis and for patients with adherent clot not receiving endoscopic hemostasis. PPI therapy should be high dose and administered as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion ( mg then mg/hour) for hours post endoscopy (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR13. ESGE does not recommend routine second-look endoscopy as part of the management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (NVUGIH). However, in patients with clinical evidence of rebleeding following successful initial endoscopic hemostasis, ESGE recommends repeat upper endoscopy with hemostasis if indicated. In the case of failure of this second attempt at hemostasis, transcatheter angiographic embolization (TAE) or surgery should be considered (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR14. In patients with NVUGIH secondary to peptic ulcer, ESGE recommends investigating for the presence of Helicobacter pylori in the acute setting with initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy when H. pylori is detected. Re-testing for H. pylori should be performed in those patients with a negative test in the acute setting. Documentation of successful H. pylori eradication is recommended (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR15. In patients receiving low dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis who develop peptic ulcer bleeding, ESGE recommends aspirin be resumed immediately following index endoscopy if the risk of rebleeding is low (e. g., FIIc, FIII). In patients with high risk peptic ulcer (FIa, FIb, FIIa, FIIb), early reintroduction of aspirin by day after index endoscopy is recommended, provided that adequate hemostasis has been established (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence)."

Previously, autoantibodies directed against melanocortin peptides were found in patients with eating disorders; however, it remains unknown whether autoantibodies directed against other appetite-regulating peptides are present in human sera and whether their levels are influenced by gut-related antigens. METHODS: Healthy women were studied for the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA autoantibodies directed against key appetite-regulating peptides. The concept of molecular mimicry was applied to search in silico whether bacteria, viruses, or fungi contain proteins with amino acid sequences identical to appetite-regulating peptides. In addition, autoantibodies serum levels were studied in germ-free and specific pathogen-free rats. RESULTS: We found these IgG and IgA autoantibodies directed against leptin, ghrelin, peptide YY, neuropeptide Y, and other appetite-regulating peptides are present in human sera at levels of - ng/mL. Numerous cases of sequence homology with these peptides were identified among commensal and pathogenic micro-organisms including Lactobacilli, bacteroides, Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, and Candida species. Decreased levels of IgA autoantibodies directed against several appetite-regulating peptides and increased levels of antighrelin IgG were found in germ-free rats compared with specific pathogen-free rats. CONCLUSION: Healthy humans and rats display autoantibodies directed against appetite-regulating peptide hormones and neuropeptides, suggesting that these autoantibodies may have physiologic implications in hunger and satiety pathways. Gut-related antigens including the intestinal microflora may influence production of theses autoantibodies, suggesting a new link between the gut and appetite control."

However, its toll is higher in more developed countries. Reasons for vast differences in mortality rates of pancreatic cancer are not completely clear yet, but it may be due to lack of appropriate diagnosis, treatment and cataloging of cancer cases. Because patients seldom exhibit symptoms until an advanced stage of the disease, pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignant neoplasms that caused , new deaths in (GLOBOCAN estimates). Globally, , new cases of pancreatic cancer have been reported in , and , new cases are estimated to occur until . Despite advancements in the detection and management of pancreatic cancer, the -year survival rate still stands at % only. To date, the causes of pancreatic carcinoma are still insufficiently known, although certain risk factors have been identified, such as tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, obesity, dietary factors, alcohol abuse, age, ethnicity, family history and genetic factors, Helicobacter pylori infection, non-O blood group and chronic pancreatitis. In general population, screening of large groups is not considered useful to detect the disease at its early stage, although newer techniques and the screening of tightly targeted groups (especially of those with family history), are being evaluated. Primary prevention is considered of utmost importance. Up-to-date statistics on pancreatic cancer occurrence and outcome along with a better understanding of the etiology and identifying the causative risk factors are essential for the primary prevention of this disease."

The H. pylori cytotoxin-associated gene (cag) pathogenicity island encodes a type IV secretion system that delivers the bacterial effector CagA into host cells after bacterial attachment, and cag+ strains augment gastric cancer risk. A host effector that is aberrantly activated in gastric cancer precursor lesions is beta-catenin, and activation of beta-catenin leads to targeted transcriptional up-regulation of genes implicated in carcinogenesis. We report that in vivo adaptation endowed an H. pylori strain with the ability to rapidly and reproducibly induce gastric dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in a rodent model of gastritis. Compared with its parental noncarcinogenic isolate, the oncogenic H. pylori strain selectively activates beta-catenin in model gastric epithelia, which is dependent on translocation of CagA into host epithelial cells. Beta-catenin nuclear accumulation is increased in gastric epithelium harvested from gerbils infected with the H. pylori carcinogenic strain as well as from persons carrying cag+ vs. cag- strains or uninfected persons. These results indicate that H. pylori-induced dysregulation of beta-catenin-dependent pathways may explain in part the augmentation in the risk of gastric cancer conferred by this pathogen."

Over % of new cases and deaths occur in developing countries. In the early years of the molecular biology revolution, cancer research mainly focuses on genetic alterations, including gastric cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms are essential for normal development and maintenance of tissue-specific gene expression patterns in mammals. Disruption of epigenetic processes can lead to altered gene function and malignant cellular transformation. Recent advancements in the rapidly evolving field of cancer epigenetics have shown extensive reprogramming of every component of the epigenetic machinery in cancer, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosome positioning, noncoding RNAs, and microRNAs. Aberrant DNA methylation in the promoter regions of gene, which leads to inactivation of tumor suppressor and other cancer-related genes in cancer cells, is the most well-defined epigenetic hallmark in gastric cancer. The advantages of gene methylation as a target for detection and diagnosis of cancer in biopsy specimens and non-invasive body fluids such as serum and gastric washes have led to many studies of application in gastric cancer. This review focuses on the most common and important phenomenon of epigenetics, DNA methylation, in gastric cancer and illustrates the impact epigenetics has had on this field."

Multilevel meta-regression models were used to determine the effect of drug resistance on treatment efficacy. RESULTS: We analysed data from studies with , participants. For triple therapies, clarithromycin resistance had a greater effect on treatment efficacy than nitroimidazole resistance. Metronidazole resistance reduced efficacy by % in triple therapies containing a nitroimidazole, tetracycline and bismuth, while efficacy was reduced by only % when a gastric acid inhibitor was added to the regimen. Quadruple therapies containing both clarithromycin and metronidazole were the most efficacious; >% of H. pylori infections were consistently eradicated with these regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance was a strong predictor of efficacy across triple therapies for the eradication of H. pylori in adults. Resistance to either clarithromycin or metronidazole, but not both simultaneously, may be overcome by using quadruple therapies, especially those containing both clarithromycin and metronidazole."

Discovery that gastric urease was not mammalian resulted in a research hiatus until discovery that gastric urease was produce by Helicobacter pylori which caused gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Gastric urease allows the organism to colonize the acidic stomach and serves as a biomarker for the presence of H. pylori. Important clinical tests for H. pylori, the rapid urease test and urea breath test, are based on gastric urease. Rapid urease tests use gastric biopsies or mucus placed in a device containing urea and an indicator of pH change, typically phenol red.

To provide evidence-based guidance, we performed a systematic review of the literature published in English, selecting articles reporting or more total patients. We identified studies including patients, of whom were evaluable for the effects of H pylori eradication on platelet count. The weighted mean complete response (platelet count > or = x ()/L) and overall response (platelet count > or = x ()/L and at least doubling of the basal count) were % (% confidence interval [CI], %-%) and % (% CI, %-%), respectively. In patients with a baseline platelet count less than x ()/L, the complete response rate was % (% CI, %-%) and the overall response rate was % (% CI, %-%). The response rate tended to be higher in countries with a high background prevalence of H pylori infection and in patients with milder degrees of thrombocytopenia. These findings suggest that the detection and eradication of H pylori infection should be considered in the work-up of patients with seemingly typical ITP."

OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the time at which multiple cancers develop and to determine whether scheduled endoscopic surveillance might control their development. DESIGN: A multicentre retrospective cohort study from hospitals was conducted. Patients with EGC who underwent ESD with en bloc margin-negative curative resection were included. Synchronous cancer was classified as concomitant cancer or missed cancer. The cumulative incidence of metachronous cancers and overall survival rate were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: From April to December , patients met the inclusion criteria. Synchronous or metachronous multiple cancers were detected in patients (%) during a mean of months. Among the synchronous cancers, were missed at the time of the initial ESD. Many of the missed lesions existed in the upper third of the stomach and the miss rate was associated with the endoscopist's inexperience (< oesophagogastroduodenoscopy cases). The cumulative incidence of metachronous cancers increased linearly and the mean annual incidence rate was %. The incidence rate did not differ between patients with or without Helicobacter pylori eradication. Four lesions (%) were detected as massively invading cancers during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Nineteen per cent of synchronous cancers were not detected until the initial ESD. The incidence rate of metachronous cancer after ESD was constant. Scheduled endoscopic surveillance showed that almost all recurrent lesions were treatable by endoscopic resection."

PPIs are acid-activated prodrugs that convert to sulfenic acids or sulfenamides that react covalently with one or more cysteines accessible from the luminal surface of the ATPase. Because of covalent binding, their inhibitory effects last much longer than their plasma half-life. However, the short half-life of the drug in the blood and the requirement for acid activation impair their efficacy in acid suppression, particularly at night. PPIs with longer half-life promise to improve acid suppression. All PPIs give excellent healing of peptic ulcers and produce good results in reflux esophagitis.

The alpha and epsilon Proteobacteria, including the important human pathogens Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Bartonella bacilliformis, require flagellar motility to efficiently infect mammalian hosts. In this study, we demonstrate that these bacteria make flagellin molecules that are not recognized by TLR5. We map the site responsible for TLR5 evasion to amino acids - of the N-terminal D1 domain, which is centrally positioned within the previously defined TLR5 recognition site. Salmonella flagellin is strongly recognized by TLR5, but mutating residues - to the corresponding H. pylori flaA sequence abolishes TLR5 recognition and also destroys bacterial motility. To preserve bacterial motility, alpha and epsilon Proteobacteria possess compensatory amino acid changes in other regions of the flagellin molecule, and we engineer a mutant form of Salmonella flagellin that evades TLR5 but retains motility. These results suggest that TLR5 evasion is critical for the survival of this subset of bacteria at mucosal sites in animals and raise the intriguing possibility that flagellin receptors provided the selective force to drive the evolution of these unique subclasses of bacterial flagellins."

Additionally, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and Helicobacter pylori infection affect motor fluctuations by interfering with the absorption of antiparkinsonian drugs. The multifaceted role of the gastrointestinal system in Parkinson's disease necessitates a specific and detailed assessment and treatment plan. The presence of pervasive α-synuclein deposition in the gastrointestinal tract strongly implicates this system in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.

Although the effects of obesity on the development of metabolic and cardiovascular problems are well studied, much less is known about the impact of obesity on immune function and infectious disease. Studies in obese humans and with obese animal models have repeatedly demonstrated impaired immune function, including decreased cytokine production, decreased response to antigen/mitogen stimulation, reduced macrophage and dendritic cell function, and natural killer cell impairment. Recent studies have demonstrated that the impaired immune response in the obese host leads to increased susceptibility to infection with a number of different pathogens such as community-acquired tuberculosis, influenza, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, coxsackievirus, Helicobacter pylori and encephalomyocarditis virus. While no specific mechanism has been defined for the decreased immune response to infectious disease in the obese host, several obesity-associated changes such as excessive inflammation, altered adipokine signaling, metabolic changes and even epigenetic regulation could affect the immune response. This review will discuss what is currently known about the relationship between obesity and infectious disease."

Although epithelial cells are normally refractory to external stimulation with peptidoglycan, these cells have been shown to respond in a NOD1-dependent manner to Gram-negative pathogens that can either invade or secrete factors into host cells. In the present work, we report that Gram-negative bacteria can deliver peptidoglycan to cytosolic NOD1 in host cells via a novel mechanism involving outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). We purified OMVs from the Gram-negative mucosal pathogens: Helicobacter pylori, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria gonorrhoea and demonstrated that these peptidoglycan containing OMVs upregulated NF-kappaB and NOD1-dependent responses in vitro. These OMVs entered epithelial cells through lipid rafts thereby inducing NOD1-dependent responses in vitro. Moreover, OMVs delivered intragastrically to mice-induced innate and adaptive immune responses via a NOD1-dependent but TLR-independent mechanism. Collectively, our findings identify OMVs as a generalized mechanism whereby Gram-negative bacteria deliver peptidoglycan to cytosolic NOD1. We propose that OMVs released by bacteria in vivo may promote inflammation and pathology in infected hosts."

Although aberrant DNA methylation is deeply involved in gastric carcinogenesis, its induction by Helicobacter pylori, a strong gastric carcinogen, is unclear. Here, we analyzed the effect of H. pylori infection on the quantity of methylated DNA molecules in noncancerous gastric mucosae and examined its association with gastric cancer risk. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gastric mucosae were collected from healthy volunteers ( H. pylori negative and H. pylori positive) and cases with differentiated-type gastric cancers ( H. pylori negative and H. pylori positive) by endoscopy. The numbers of DNA molecules methylated and unmethylated for eight regions of seven CpG islands (CGI) were quantified by quantitative PCR after bisulfite modification, and fractions of methylated molecules (methylation levels) were calculated. RESULTS: Among healthy volunteers, methylation levels of all the eight regions were - to -fold higher in H. pylori positives than in H. pylori negatives (P < ). Methylation levels of the LOX, HAND1, and THBD promoter CGIs and p41ARC exonic CGI were as high as % or more in H. pylori-positive individuals. Among H. pylori-negative individuals, methylation levels of all the eight regions were - to -fold higher in gastric cancer cases than in age-matched healthy volunteers (P < or = ). Among H. pylori-positive individuals, methylation levels were highly variable, and that of only HAND1 was significantly increased in gastric cancer cases (-fold, P = ). CONCLUSIONS: It was indicated that H. pylori infection potently induces methylation of CGIs to various degrees. Methylation levels of specific CGIs seemed to reflect gastric cancer risk in H. pylori-negative individuals."

Although Helicobacter pylori infection is the main risk factor, in about % or more of gastric cancers, the molecular pathway underlying H. pylori infection leading to the development of gastric cancers remains unclear. Recently accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) may regulate diverse biological processes and may be important in tumorigenesis. miR- has been frequently observed to be aberrantly overexpressed in various tumors. Using TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR, we confirmed that miR- was significantly overexpressed in human gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Remarkably, miR- was also significantly overexpressed in H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa, implying that overexpression of miR- in gastric cancer may be due in part to H. pylori infection. More importantly, we showed that forced expression of miR- significantly enhanced cell proliferation and invasion in AGS cells, a human gastric cancer cell line, whereas knockdown of miR- by inhibitor caused a significant reduction in cell proliferation and a significant increase in apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that knockdown of miR- significantly decreased cell invasion and migration of AGS cells. Finally, we showed that RECK, a known tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, is a bona fide target of miR-. Taken together, miR- may be important in the initiation and progression of gastric cancers as an oncomiR, likely through regulating RECK. Our findings suggest a potential regulatory pathway in which H. pylori infection upregulates expression of miR-, which in turn downregulates RECK, and then leads to the development of gastric cancer."

DC-SIGN was constitutively associated with a signalosome complex consisting of the scaffold proteins LSP1, KSR1 and CNK and the kinase Raf-. Mannose-expressing Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus type (HIV-) induced the recruitment of effector proteins to the DC-SIGN signalosome to activate Raf-, whereas fucose-expressing pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori actively dissociated the KSR1-CNK-Raf- complex from the DC-SIGN signalosome. This dynamic regulation of the signalosome by mannose- and fucose-expressing pathogens led to the enhancement or suppression of proinflammatory responses, respectively. Our study reveals another level of plasticity in tailoring adaptive immunity to pathogens."

The addition of bismuth (i.e., -day triple therapy plus bismuth) can improve cure rates despite a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. The major bismuth effect is to add an additional %-% to the success with resistant infections. The overall result is therefore dependent on the prevalence of resistance and the treatment success in the subpopulation with resistant infections (eg, with proton-pump inhibitor-amoxicillin dual therapy).

Helicobacter pylori infects more than % of the world's population with higher prevalence in developing countries than developed countries. The prevalence of H. pylori varies in different societies and geographical locations. The objectives of this study were to estimate the seroprevalence and determine the risk factors of H. pylori infection in dyspeptic patents in Ethiopia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving dyspeptic patients was carried out from February to April , . Five to ten ml venous blood was collected from each dyspeptic patient and analyzed for detection of Helicobacter pylori immunoglobulin (IgG). The socio-demographic characteristic, hygienic practices, alcohol consumption, sources of drinking water and types of latrine were also obtained with a pre-tested questionnaire. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori was %. There was statistically significant difference in the prevalence of H. pylori among age groups (p=). Seroprevalence of H. pylori was higher in those patients who used unprotected surface water (%) than those with access to piped tap water (%). There was also statistically significant differences in prevalence of H. pylori with the habit of hand washing before meal (p=) and alcohol consumption (p=). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of H. pylori was high in the study area and increased with age of dyspeptic patients. Alcohol consumption and the type of drinking water are risk factors that have associations with the prevalence of H. pylori. Molecular epidemiological techniques can show a true picture of H. pylori and improvement in the drinking water quality is recommended."

The TLR4+896A>G polymorphism linked with impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide may play a role in gastric carcinogenesis. METHODS: We assessed associations with premalignant gastric changes in relatives of gastric cancer patients, including with hypochlorhydria and gastric atrophy. We also genotyped independent Caucasian population-based case-control studies of upper gastrointestinal tract cancer, initially in noncardia gastric carcinoma cases and controls and then in noncardia gastric carcinomas, cardia carcinomas, esophageal cancers, and frequency-matched controls. Odds ratios were computed from logistic models and adjusted for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: TLR4+896G carriers had an -fold (% confidence interval [CI], -) increased odds ratio (OR) for hypochlorhydria; the polymorphism was unassociated with gastric acid output in the absence of H pylori infection. Carriers also had significantly more severe gastric atrophy and inflammation. Seventeen percent of gastric carcinoma patients in the initial study and % of the noncardia gastric carcinoma patients in the replication study had or TLR4 variant alleles vs % of both control populations (combined OR = ; % CI = -). In contrast, prevalence of TLR4+896G was not significantly increased in esophageal squamous cell (%, OR = ) or adenocarcinoma (%, OR = ) or gastric cardia carcinoma (%, OR = ). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the TLR4+896A>G polymorphism is a risk factor for noncardia gastric carcinoma and its precursors. The findings underscore the role of the host innate immune response in outcome of H pylori infection."

Haggitt Gastrointestinal Pathology Society.,"Helicobacter pylori is a major cause of gastroduodenal injury, gastric cancer, and lymphoma, and, thus, there is great interest in its detection and eradication. Several detection methods are available, including histochemical and immunohistochemical stains. Application of these stains in clinical practice is heterogenous, to say the least. Although they were developed to enhance H. pylori detection, changing practice models, financial considerations, and a perceived need for rapid case turnaround have led to their widespread use in routine staining studies ordered reflexively on all gastric biopsies. Emerging data suggest that most of these stains are not needed to establish a diagnosis of H. pylori infection, and their added value when biopsies show minimal, or no, inflammation is not clear. In this manuscript, the Rodger C. Haggitt Gastrointestinal Pathology Society puts forth recommendations regarding ancillary stain usage for H. pylori detection based upon critical literature review and collective experience. Pathologists rarely, if ever, detect H. pylori in ""normal"" biopsies, but readily observe them in optimally stained hematoxylin and eosin sections from infected patients. Therefore, we suggest that use of ancillary stains is appropriate when biopsies show chronic, or chronic active, gastritis without detectable H. pylori in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, but performing them ""up front"" on all gastric biopsies is generally unnecessary. Application of these stains to nongastric biopsies and polyps is appropriate in an extremely limited set of circumstances. It is our hope that recommendations provided herein will provide helpful information to gastroenterologists, pathologists, and others involved in the evaluation of patients for possible H. pylori infection."

We determined the association between PPIs use and gastric cancer (GC) among HP-infected subjects who had received HP therapy.

We identified adults who had received an outpatient prescription of clarithromycin-based triple therapy between year and . Patients who failed this regimen, and those diagnosed to have GC within months after HP therapy, or gastric ulcer after therapy were excluded. Prescriptions of PPIs or histamine- receptor antagonists (H2RA) started within months before GC were excluded to avoid protopathic bias. We evaluated GC risk with PPIs by Cox proportional hazards model with propensity score adjustment. H2RA was used as a negative control exposure. RESULT: Among the eligible subjects, (%) developed GC during a median follow-up of years. PPIs use was associated with an increased GC risk (HR , % CI to ), while H2RA was not (HR , % CI to ). The risk increased with duration of PPIs use (HR , % CI to ; , % CI to and , % CI to for ≥ year, ≥ years and ≥ years, respectively).

While it is clear that cell signaling elicited by inflammatory cytokines promotes tumor development, the impact of DNA damage production resulting from inflammation-associated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) on tumor development has not been directly tested. RONS induce DNA damage that can be recognized by alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (Aag) to initiate base excision repair. Using a mouse model of episodic inflammatory bowel disease by repeated administration of dextran sulfate sodium in the drinking water, we show that Aag-mediated DNA repair prevents colonic epithelial damage and reduces the severity of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colon tumorigenesis. Importantly, DNA base lesions expected to be induced by RONS and recognized by Aag accumulated to higher levels in Aag-deficient animals following stimulation of colonic inflammation. Finally, as a test of the generality of this effect we show that Aag-deficient animals display more severe gastric lesions that are precursors of gastric cancer after chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori. These data demonstrate that the repair of DNA lesions formed by RONS during chronic inflammation is important for protection against colon carcinogenesis."

We determined whether there is an increased need for thyroxine in patients with euthyroid multinodular goiter and impaired secretion of gastric acid. METHODS: We assessed the dose of thyroxine required to obtain a low level of thyrotropin ( to mU per liter) in patients with multinodular goiter. Of these patients, also had Helicobacter pylori-related gastritis and had atrophic gastritis of the body of the stomach ( with evidence of H. pylori infection and without such evidence). The reference group comprised patients with multinodular goiter and no gastric disorders. In addition, variation in the level of serum thyrotropin was prospectively studied in patients treated with thyroxine before and after H. pylori infection and both before and during treatment with omeprazole in patients treated with thyroxine who had gastroesophageal reflux. RESULTS: The daily requirement of thyroxine was higher (by to percent) in patients with H. pylori-related gastritis, atrophic gastritis, or both conditions than in the reference group. In prospective studies, the occurrence of H. pylori infection in the patients treated with thyroxine led to an increase in the level of serum thyrotropin (P=), an effect that was nearly reversed on eradication of H. pylori infection. In a similar way, omeprazole treatment was associated with an increase in the level of serum thyrotropin in all patients treated with thyroxine, an effect that was reversed by an increase in the thyroxine dose by percent. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with impaired acid secretion require an increased dose of thyroxine, suggesting that normal gastric acid secretion is necessary for effective absorption of oral thyroxine."

Understanding and preventing the occurrence of this cancer are complicated by the fact that the major histologic types, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ACE), differ substantially in their underlying patterns of incidence and key etiologic factors. The main characteristic that they share is a high mortality rate. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data for the United States show a % drop in incidence of SCC between and , with declines greatest in black males, although incidence in this group remains high compared with other groups. Incidence of ACE has increased -fold over the same period, with a nearly -fold increase in white males. Alcohol and smoking are major, established risk factors for SCC. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is consistently associated with increased risk of ACE, whereas infection with Helicobacter pylori may reduce its incidence. Increasing body mass index is also strongly associated with ACE risk while showing no association or an inverse relationship with SCC. Diet affects both types of esophageal cancer, with a higher intake of fruits and vegetables associated with reduced incidence. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are currently the most promising chemoprevention candidates for both cancer types. Lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and exercise, are additional ways in which the incidence of ACE might be reduced."

Both experimental and clinical pharmacology clearly show that this compound is a nonsystemic antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antibacterial action covering Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, both aerobes and anaerobes. Being virtually nonabsorbed, its bioavailability within the GI tract is rather high with intraluminal and fecal drug concentrations that largely exceed the minimal inhibitory concentration values observed in vitro against a wide range of pathogenic organisms. The GI tract represents, therefore, the primary therapeutic target and GI infections the main indication. The appreciation of the pathogenic role of gut bacteria in several organic and functional GI diseases has increasingly broadened its clinical use, which is now extended to hepatic encephalopathy, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease and colonic diverticular disease. Potential indications include the irritable bowel syndrome and chronic constipation, Clostridium difficile infection and bowel preparation before colorectal surgery. Because of its antibacterial activity against the microorganism and the lack of strains with primary resistance, some preliminary studies have explored the rifaximin potential for Helicobacter pylori eradication. Oral administration of this drug, by getting rid of enteric bacteria, could also be employed to achieve selective bowel decontamination in acute pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis (thus preventing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use (lessening in that way NSAID enteropathy). This antibiotic has, therefore, little value outside the enteric area and this will minimize both antimicrobial resistance and systemic adverse events. Indeed, the drug proved to be safe in all patient populations, including young children. Although rifaximin has stood the test of time, it still attracts the attention of both basic scientists and clinicians. As a matter of fact, with the advancement of the knowledge on microbial-gut interactions in health and disease novel indications and new drug regimens are being explored. Besides widening the clinical use, the research on rifaximin is also focused on the synthesis of new derivatives and on the development of original formulations designed to expand the spectrum of its clinical use."

Gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from colonic cancer or gastric cancer, and malabsorption in coeliac disease are the most important causes that need to be sought. DEFINING IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA: The lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test should be used to define anaemia (B). Any level of anaemia should be investigated in the presence of iron deficiency (B). The lower the haemoglobin the more likely there is to be serious underlying pathology and the more urgent is the need for investigation (B). Red cell indices provide a sensitive indication of iron deficiency in the absence of chronic disease or haemoglobinopathy (A). Haemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis and hypochromia are present in patients of appropriate ethnic background to prevent unnecessary GI investigation (C). Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deficiency (A). INVESTIGATIONS: Upper and lower GI investigations should be considered in all postmenopausal female and all male patients where IDA has been confirmed unless there is a history of significant overt non-GI blood loss (A). All patients should be screened for coeliac disease (B). If oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed as the initial GI investigation, only the presence of advanced gastric cancer or coeliac disease should deter lower GI investigation (B). In patients aged > or with marked anaemia or a significant family history of colorectal carcinoma, lower GI investigation should still be considered even if coeliac disease is found (B). Colonoscopy has advantages over CT colography for investigation of the lower GI tract in IDA, but either is acceptable (B). Either is preferable to barium enema, which is useful if they are not available. Further direct visualisation of the small bowel is not necessary unless there are symptoms suggestive of small bowel disease, or if the haemoglobin cannot be restored or maintained with iron therapy (B). In patients with recurrent IDA and normal OGD and colonoscopy results, Helicobacter pylori should be eradicated if present. (C). Faecal occult blood testing is of no benefit in the investigation of IDA (B). All premenopausal women with IDA should be screened for coeliac disease, but other upper and lower GI investigation should be reserved for those aged years or older, those with symptoms suggesting gastrointestinal disease, and those with a strong family history of colorectal cancer (B). Upper and lower GI investigation of IDA in post-gastrectomy patients is recommended in those over years of age (B). In patients with iron deficiency without anaemia, endoscopic investigation rarely detects malignancy. Such investigation should be considered in patients aged > after discussing the risk and potential benefit with them (C). Only postmenopausal women and men aged > years should have GI investigation of iron deficiency without anaemia (C). Rectal examination is seldom contributory, and, in the absence of symptoms such as rectal bleeding and tenesmus, may be postponed until colonoscopy. Urine testing for blood is important in the examination of patients with IDA (B). MANAGEMENT: All patients should have iron supplementation both to correct anaemia and replenish body stores (B). Parenteral iron can be used when oral preparations are not tolerated (C). Blood transfusions should be reserved for patients with or at risk of cardiovascular instability due to the degree of their anaemia (C)."

We characterized bacterial diversity within the human gastric mucosa by using a small subunit 16S rDNA clone library approach and analyzed , sequences generated by broad-range bacterial PCR from gastric endoscopic biopsy samples. A diverse community of phylotypes was identified, featuring diversity at this site greater than previously described. The majority of sequences were assigned to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria phyla. Ten percent of the phylotypes were previously uncharacterized, including a Deinococcus-related organism, relatives of which have been found in extreme environments but not reported before in humans. The gastric clone libraries from subjects contained H. pylori rDNA; however, only of these subjects tested positive for H. pylori by conventional laboratory methods. Statistical analysis revealed a large degree of intersubject variability of the gastric ecosystem. The presence of H. pylori did not affect the composition of the gastric community. This gastric bacterial rDNA data set was significantly different from sequence collections of the human mouth and esophagus described in other studies, indicating that the human stomach may be home to a distinct microbial eco-system. The gastric microbiota may play important, as-yet-undiscovered roles in human health and disease."

DESIGN: Case-control study, logistic regression analysis. SETTING: Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, from to . PARTICIPANTS: Community residents to years of age, of white, black, or Mexican-American ethnicity. Nonsmokers included never-smokers and former smokers with a < pack-year smoking history who had never smoked cigars or pipes. MEASUREMENTS: COPD (FEV1/FVC < %) was classified as mild (FEV1 > or = % predicted) or moderate to severe (FEV1 to % predicted). RESULTS: Among , examinees, +/- % were female, mean age was +/- years, +/- % were nonsmokers, +/- % had mild COPD, and +/- % had moderate-to-severe COPD [+/- SE]. One fourth of mild and moderate-to-severe cases were nonsmokers. Among , nonsmokers, +/- % had mild COPD (n = ; age, +/- years) and were mostly female (%), while +/- % had moderate-to-severe COPD (n = , age +/- ) and were mostly male (%). Few nonsmokers with COPD ( +/- %) had a previous diagnosis of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Among nonsmokers, physician-diagnosed asthma increased the risk of mild and especially of moderate-to-severe COPD. Independently of asthma, risk of mild COPD in nonsmokers increased with age (doubling every years), before age was lower among men than women, and was inversely associated with current exposure to tobacco smoke at home and at work. In contrast, the risk of moderate-to-severe COPD in nonsmokers was markedly associated with male gender, peaked in middle age, and was inversely associated with nonwhite ethnicity. COPD risks did not vary by minimal smoking history, longest-held occupation, urban residence, income, allergies, thyroid disease, or Helicobacter pylori antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Among nonsmokers, mild and moderate-to-severe COPD are associated with asthma but otherwise have distinct demographic profiles, suggesting that moderate-to-severe disease is not a mere progression of mild COPD."

ParB (partition protein B) and its regulatory protein, ParA, act cooperatively through parS (partition S) DNA to facilitate chromosome segregation. ParB binds to chromosomal DNA at specific parS sites as well as the neighboring nonspecific DNA sites. Various ParB molecules can associate together and spread along the chromosomal DNA. ParB oligomer and parS DNA interact together to form a high-order nucleoprotein that is required for the loading of the structural maintenance of chromosomes proteins onto the chromosome for chromosomal DNA condensation. In this report, we characterized the binding of parS and Spo0J from Helicobacter pylori (HpSpo0J) and solved the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain truncated protein (Ct-HpSpo0J)-parS complex. Ct-HpSpo0J folds into an elongated structure that includes a flexible N-terminal domain for protein-protein interaction and a conserved DNA-binding domain for parS binding. Two Ct-HpSpo0J molecules bind with one parS. Ct-HpSpo0J interacts vertically and horizontally with its neighbors through the N-terminal domain to form an oligomer. These adjacent and transverse interactions are accomplished via a highly conserved arginine patch: RRLR. These interactions might be needed for molecular assembly of a high-order nucleoprotein complex and for ParB spreading.

We aimed to assess the real-time diagnostic validity of high resolution endoscopy with and without NBI in the diagnosis of gastric premalignant conditions and to derive a classification for endoscopic grading of gastric intestinal metaplasia (EGGIM). METHODS: A multicenter prospective study (five centers: Portugal, Italy, Romania, UK, USA) was performed involving the systematic use of high resolution gastroscopes with image registry with and without NBI in a centralized informatics platform (available online). All users used the same NBI classification. Histologic result was considered the diagnostic gold standard. RESULTS: A total of patients and endoscopic biopsies were included. NBI globally increased diagnostic accuracy by percentage points (NBI % vs. WLE %; P < ) with no difference in the identification of Helicobacter pylori gastritis ( % vs. %). NBI increased sensitivity for the diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia significantly ( % vs. %; P < ) and for the diagnosis of dysplasia ( % vs. %). The added benefit of NBI in terms of diagnostic accuracy was greater in OLGIM III/IV than in OLGIM I/II ( percentage points vs. percentage points, respectively; P < ). The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for EGGIM in the identification of extensive metaplasia was . CONCLUSIONS: In a real-time scenario, NBI demonstrates a high concordance with gastric histology, superior to WLE. Diagnostic accuracy higher than % suggests that routine use of NBI allows targeted instead of random biopsy samples. EGGIM also permits immediate grading of intestinal metaplasia without biopsies and merits further investigation."

METHODS: We analysed human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 and HLA-DPB1 alleles, and IgG antibodies against Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, varicella zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) in patients with NMO, including patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and unrelated healthy controls. NMO/NMOSD patients were seropositive for AQP4 antibody while were seronegative. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, NMO/NMOSD patients showed a significantly lower frequency of DRB1* and significantly higher frequencies of DRB1* and DPB1*, which conferred susceptibility to anti-AQP4 antibody positive NMO/NMOSD, but not antibody negative NMO/NMOSD. DRB1* was a common protective allele, irrespective of the presence or absence of anti-AQP4 antibody. Anti-H pylori and anti-C pneumoniae antibodies were more commonly detected in anti-AQP4 antibody positive NMO/NMOSD patients than healthy controls. Antibody negative NMO/NMOSD patients did not differ from healthy controls regarding the presence of these antibodies. The presence or absence of antibodies against varicella zoster virus and EBNA did not vary among the groups. The frequencies of antibodies against these four pathogens were not significantly different between MS patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HLA-DRB1* and DPB1* alleles and H pylori and Chlamydia pneumonia infection are risk factors only for anti-AQP4 antibody positive NMO/NMOSD but not for anti-AQP4 antibody negative NMO/NMOSD."

The primary objective of the present study was to gain insight into the relevant mechanisms of action using analogues of HP(-) together with model liposomes of various lipid compositions and electron microscopy. We determined that these analogues, HPA3 and HPA3NT3, exert potent antibacterial effects in low-salt buffer and antifungal activity against chitin-containing fungi, while having little or no hemolytic activity or cytotoxicity against mammalian cell lines. Our examination of the interaction of HP(-) and its analogues with liposomes showed that the peptides disturb both neutral and negatively-charged membranes, as demonstrated by the release of encapsulated fluorescent markers. The release of fluorescent markers induced by HP(-) and its analogues was inversely related to marker size. The pore created by HP(-) shows that the radius is approximately nm, whereas HPA3, HPA3NT3, and melittin have apparent radii between and nm. Finally, as shown by electron microscopy, the liposomes and various microbial cells treated with HPA3 and HPA3NT3 showed oligomerization and blebbing similar to that seen with melittin, while HP(-) exhibited flabbiness. These results suggest that HP(-) may exert its antibiotic effects through a small pore (about nm), whereas HPA3 and HPA3NT3 formed pores of a size consistent with those formed by melittin."

The exact mechanisms by which VacA contributes to infection are unclear. We previously found that limited exposure to VacA induces autophagy of gastric cells, which eliminates the toxin; we investigated whether autophagy serves as a defense mechanism against H pylori infection. METHODS: We investigated the effect of VacA on autophagy in human gastric epithelial cells and primary gastric cells from mice. Expression of p62, a marker of autophagy, was also assessed in gastric tissues from patients infected with toxigenic (VacA(+)) or nontoxigenic strains. We analyzed the effect of VacA on autophagy in peripheral blood monocytes obtained from subjects with different genotypes of ATG16L1, which regulates autophagy. We performed genotyping for ATG16L1 in cohorts of infected and uninfected subjects. RESULTS: Prolonged exposure of human gastric epithelial cells and mouse gastric cells to VacA disrupted induction of autophagy in response to the toxin, because the cells lacked cathepsin D in autophagosomes. Loss of autophagy resulted in the accumulation of p62 and reactive oxygen species. Gastric biopsy samples from patients infected with VacA(+), but not nontoxigenic strains of H pylori, had increased levels of p62. Peripheral blood monocytes isolated from individuals with polymorphisms in ATG16L1 that increase susceptibility to Crohn's disease had reduced induction of autophagy in response to VacA(+) compared to cells from individuals that did not have these polymorphisms. The presence of the ATG16L1 Crohn's disease risk variant increased susceptibility to H pylori infection in separate cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Autophagy protects against infection with H pylori; the toxin VacA disrupts autophagy to promote infection, which could contribute to inflammation and eventual carcinogenesis."

This results in chronic active gastritis, the background from which gastric carcinoma arises via the epithelial precursor lesions, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia. Therefore, the question is arising whether gastric carcinoma cells are also able to interact with H. pylori. In this study, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 expression was investigated on tumor cells of gastric carcinoma and on its precursor lesions, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia, by immunohistochemistry. Gastric epithelium with intestinal metaplasia (n=) and dysplasia (n=) expressed TLR4 and TLR5. TLR4 was strongly expressed by tumor cells of out of and TLR5 by tumor cells of all patients with gastric carcinoma. TLR9, however, was not detectable in intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia and only focally in out of gastric carcinomas. In contrast to H. pylori gastritis, epithelial TLR expression in intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and gastric carcinoma was diffusely distributed without subcellular polarization as demonstrated by confocal microscopy. This is the first study describing TLR expression on tumor cells of gastric carcinoma and its precursor lesions. Expression of TLRs enables gastric carcinoma cells to interact with H. pylori. As H. pylori can induce gastric carcinoma-promoting factors, such as IL-, via epithelial TLR expression, TLR expression by gastric carcinoma cells may have a dangerous potential."

The symbiotic interactions between resident micro-organisms and the digestive tract highly contribute to maintain the gut homeostasis. However, alterations to the microbiome caused by environmental changes (e.g., infection, diet and/or lifestyle) can disturb this symbiotic relationship and promote disease, such as inflammatory bowel diseases and cancer. Colorectal cancer is a complex association of tumoral cells, non-neoplastic cells and a large amount of micro-organisms, and the involvement of the microbiota in colorectal carcinogenesis is becoming increasingly clear. Indeed, many changes in the bacterial composition of the gut microbiota have been reported in colorectal cancer, suggesting a major role of dysbiosis in colorectal carcinogenesis. Some bacterial species have been identified and suspected to play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis, such as Streptococcus bovis, Helicobacter pylori, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium septicum, Fusobacterium spp. and Escherichia coli. The potential pro-carcinogenic effects of these bacteria are now better understood. In this review, we discuss the possible links between the bacterial microbiota and colorectal carcinogenesis, focusing on dysbiosis and the potential pro-carcinogenic properties of bacteria, such as genotoxicity and other virulence factors, inflammation, host defenses modulation, bacterial-derived metabolism, oxidative stress and anti-oxidative defenses modulation. We lastly describe how bacterial microbiota modifications could represent novel prognosis markers and/or targets for innovative therapeutic strategies."

In this review, we describe the general risk factors for gastric cancer and define high risk group for gastric cancer. We discuss strategies for the effective management of patients for the prevention and early detection of gastric cancer. Atrophic gastritis (AG) and intestinal metaplasia (IM) are the most significant risk factors for gastric cancer. Therefore, the accurate selection of individuals with AG and IM may be a key strategy for the prevention and/or early detection of gastric cancer. Although endoscopic evaluation using enhanced technologies such as narrow band imaging-magnification, the serum pepsinogen test, Helicobacter pylori serology, and trefoil factor have been evaluated, a gold standard method to accurately select individuals with AG and IM has not emerged. In terms of managing patients at high risk of gastric cancer, it remains uncertain whether H. pylori eradication reverses and/or prevents the progression of AG and IM. Although endoscopic surveillance in high risk patients is expected to be beneficial, further prospective studies in large populations are needed to determine the optimal surveillance interval."

METHODS: A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ACP Journal Club, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, Cochrane Methodology Register, Health Technology Assessment Database, and abstracts from prominent gastrointestinal scientific meetings was carried out. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bismuth quadruple therapy to clarithromycin triple therapy were selected for meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers extracted data, using standardized data forms. Meta-analysis was carried out with the metan command in Stata . Funnel plots and subgroup analyses were carried out. RESULTS: Nine RCTs (N=,) were included. Although dosing regimens of clarithromycin triple therapy were quite consistent between trials, dosing regimens varied considerably for bismuth quadruple therapy. Bismuth quadruple therapy achieved eradication in % of patients, whereas clarithromycin triple therapy achieved an eradication rate of % (risk ratio (RR)=, % confidence interval (CI): -). There was moderate heterogeneity and no evidence for significant publication bias. Subgroup analyses by study location, treatment duration, and study population did not account for the heterogeneity. There were no statistically significant differences in side effects yielded by quadruple vs. clarithromycin triple therapy (RR=, % CI: -). CONCLUSIONS: Quadruple and triple therapies yielded similar eradication rates as primary therapy for H. pylori infection. Both therapies yielded suboptimal eradication rates.

Although surgery is the standard treatment for this disease, early detection and treatment is the only way to reduce mortality. This Review summarises the epidemiology of gastric cancer, and the evidence for, and current practices of, screening in Asia. Few Asian countries have implemented a national screening programme for gastric cancer; most have adopted opportunistic screening of high-risk individuals only. Although screening by endoscopy seems to be the most accurate method for detection of gastric cancer, the availability of endoscopic instruments and expertise for mass screening remains questionable--even in developed countries such as Japan. Therefore, barium studies or serum-pepsinogen testing are sometimes used as the initial screening tool in some countries, and patients with abnormal results are screened by endoscopy. Despite the strong link between infection with Helicobacter pylori and gastric cancer, more data are needed to define the role of its eradication in the prevention of gastric cancer in Asia. At present, there is a paucity of quality data from Asia to lend support for screening for gastric cancer."

Side effects occurred in % of subjects and occurred significantly more frequently in the LBTM group than the other groups (vs LBTF, P = .; vs LBAT, P = .; vs LBAF, P = .). Metronidazole resistance was %; no isolates were resistant to amoxicillin, tetracycline, or furazolidone. CONCLUSIONS: Four bismuth-containing quadruple therapies achieved greater than % eradication of H pylori in patients who did not respond to previous treatment, including patients with metronidazole resistance. For patients allergic to penicillin, tetracycline and either metronidazole- or furazolidone-containing regimens are recommended. ClincialTrials.gov number, NCT01668927."

However, modern disease indicators must now consider complex data from gene-based research along with traditional clinical parameters. Rosacea is a skin disorder with multiple signs and symptoms. In individuals, these features may be multiple or one may predominate. While studies on the epidemiology of rosacea have previously been sparse, there has been a recent increase in research activity. A broader body of epidemiological information that includes a greater variety of countries beyond Northern Europe and general population-based demographics is needed. As there are operational issues in current case definitions of rosacea subtypes--rationalization and standardization--universal consistent applications in future research is also imperative. Further improvement in disease definition combining new research information along with clinical pragmatism should increase the accuracy of rosacea case ascertainment and facilitate further epidemiological research."

These two treatments have similar effectiveness, but they are insufficient for protection of patients at very high risk for ulcer bleeding. We aimed to test the hypothesis that in patients with previous ulcer bleeding induced by non-selective NSAIDs, combined treatment with the COX inhibitor celecoxib and the PPI esomeprazole would be better than celecoxib alone for prevention of recurrent ulcer bleeding. METHODS: consecutively presenting patients who were taking non-selective NSAIDs for arthritis were recruited to our single-centre, prospective, randomised, double-blind trial after admission to hospital with upper-gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients were enrolled after their ulcers had healed and a histological test for Helicobacter pylori was negative. All patients were given mg celecoxib twice daily. patients were randomly assigned to receive mg esomeprazole twice daily (combined-treatment group), and to receive a placebo (control group) for months. The primary endpoint was recurrent ulcer bleeding during treatment or within month of the end of treatment. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00365313. FINDINGS: Combination treatment was more effective than celecoxib alone for prevention of ulcer bleeding in patients at high risk. The -month cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint was % in the combined-treatment group and (%) in the controls (% CI difference, to ; p=). The median follow-up was months (range -). Discontinuation of treatment and the incidence of adverse events were similar in the two treatment groups. INTERPRETATION: Patients at very high risk for recurrent ulcer bleeding who need anti-inflammatory analgesics should receive combination treatment with a COX inhibitor and a PPI.

This underscores the importance of diagnosis and risk stratification for these patients. High definition endoscopy with chromoendoscopy (CE) is better than high definition white-light endoscopy alone for this purpose. Virtual CE can guide biopsies for staging atrophic and metaplastic changes and can target neoplastic lesions. Biopsies should be taken from at least two topographic sites (antrum and corpus) and labelled in two separate vials. For patients with mild to moderate atrophy restricted to the antrum there is no evidence to recommend surveillance. In patients with IM at a single location but with a family history of gastric cancer, incomplete IM, or persistent Helicobacter pylori gastritis, endoscopic surveillance with CE and guided biopsies may be considered in years. Patients with advanced stages of atrophic gastritis should be followed up with a high quality endoscopy every years. In patients with dysplasia, in the absence of an endoscopically defined lesion, immediate high quality endoscopic reassessment with CE is recommended. Patients with an endoscopically visible lesion harboring low or high grade dysplasia or carcinoma should undergo staging and treatment. H. pylori eradication heals nonatrophic chronic gastritis, may lead to regression of atrophic gastritis, and reduces the risk of gastric cancer in patients with these conditions, and it is recommended. H. pylori eradication is also recommended for patients with neoplasia after endoscopic therapy. In intermediate to high risk regions, identification and surveillance of patients with precancerous gastric conditions is cost-effective."

H. pylori combats oxidative stress via a battery of diverse activities, some of which are unique or newly described. In addition to using the well-studied bacterial oxidative stress resistance enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase, H. pylori depends on a family of peroxiredoxins (alkylhydroperoxide reductase, bacterioferritin co-migratory protein and a thiol-peroxidase) that function to detoxify organic peroxides. Newly described antioxidant proteins include a soluble NADPH quinone reductase (MdaB) and an iron sequestering protein (NapA) that has dual roles - host inflammation stimulation and minimizing reactive oxygen species production within H. pylori. An H. pylori arginase attenuates host inflammation, a thioredoxin required as a reductant for many oxidative stress enzymes is also a chaperon, and some novel properties of KatA and AhpC were discovered. To repair oxidative DNA damage, H. pylori uses an endonuclease (Nth), DNA recombination pathways and a newly described type of bacterial MutS2 that specifically recognizes -oxoguanine. A methionine sulphoxide reductase (Msr) plays a role in reducing the overall oxidized protein content of the cell, although it specifically targets oxidized Met residues. H. pylori possess few stress regulator proteins, but the key roles of a ferric uptake regulator (Fur) and a post-transcriptional regulator CsrA in antioxidant protein expression are described. The roles of all of these antioxidant systems have been addressed by a targeted mutant analysis approach and almost all are shown to be important in host colonization. The described antioxidant systems in H. pylori are expected to be relevant to many bacterial-associated diseases, as genes for most of the enzymes carrying out the newly described roles are present in a number of pathogenic bacteria."

Our hypotheses were that the prevalence of H. pylori in patients undergoing RYGB is similar to that of the general population and that preoperative H. pylori testing and treatment does not decrease the incidence of anastomotic ulcer or pouch gastritis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of H. pylori serology, preoperative and postoperative endoscopy findings, and the development of anastomotic ulcer or erosive pouch gastritis was performed. All patients positive for H. pylori received treatment. Univariate parametric and nonparametric statistical tests, as well as multiple logistic regression analyses, were performed. RESULTS: A total of LRYGB patients were included in the study. Of these patients, (%) were tested for H. pylori and (%) were not. Of the patients, (%) tested positive for H. pylori, (%) tested negative, and (%) had an equivocal result. Postoperatively, patients (%) underwent upper endoscopy. Of these patients, (%) had positive endoscopy findings for anastomotic ulcer (n = ) or erosive pouch gastritis (n = ).

Over this time, the epidemiology of EoE has also rapidly evolved. EoE has transformed from a rare case-reportable condition to disease that is commonly encountered in the gastroenterology clinic, hospital emergency room, and endoscopy suite. The incidence and prevalence are increasing at rates that outpace increased disease recognition. Current incidence estimates range from to cases per ,, and current prevalence estimates range from to case per . We review the data and potential reasons behind this increase, examine risk factors, and identify important areas for research into disease etiology. The article also discusses the progression of EoE from an inflammatory to fibrostenotic phenotype. An accurate view of the natural history of EoE is central to discussions with patients regarding disease prognosis and decisions about long-term use of medical, endoscopic, and diet therapies. Progressive remodelling appears to be gradual, but not universal, and the duration of untreated disease is the best predictor of stricture risk. Ultimately, prospective, long-term outcome studies focusing on multiple aspects of disease activity are needed to fully understand the natural history of EoE."

Remarkably, H. pylori can persistently colonize the stomach for decades or an entire lifetime despite development of an acquired immune response. This review focuses on the immune response to H. pylori and the mechanisms by which H. pylori resists immune clearance. Three main sections of the review are devoted to (i) analysis of the immune response to H. pylori in humans, (ii) analysis of interactions of H. pylori with host immune defenses in animal models, and (iii) interactions of H. pylori with immune cells in vitro. The topics addressed in this review are important for understanding how H. pylori resists immune clearance and also are relevant for understanding the pathogenesis of diseases caused by H. pylori (peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric lymphoma)."

In selenium deficiency, benign strains of Coxsackie and influenza viruses can mutate to highly pathogenic strains. Dietary supplementation to provide adequate or supranutritional selenium supply has been proposed to confer health benefits for patients suffering from some viral diseases, most notably with respect to HIV and influenza A virus (IAV) infections. In addition, selenium-containing multimicronutrient supplements improved several clinical and lifestyle variables in patients coinfected with HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Selenium status may affect the function of cells of both adaptive and innate immunity. Supranutritional selenium promotes proliferation and favors differentiation of naive CD4-positive T lymphocytes toward T helper cells, thus supporting the acute cellular immune response, whereas excessive activation of the immune system and ensuing host tissue damage are counteracted through directing macrophages toward the M2 phenotype. This review provides an up-to-date overview on selenium in infectious diseases caused by viruses (e.g., HIV, IAV, hepatitis C virus, poliovirus, West Nile virus) and bacteria (e.g., M. tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori). Data from epidemiologic studies and intervention trials, with selenium alone or in combination with other micronutrients, and animal experiments are discussed against the background of dietary selenium requirements to alter immune functions."

Furthermore, gastric cancer in Asia is one of the frequent diseases on which to perform treatments. We introduced the technique of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with duodenojejunal bypass (LSG/DJB) for patients with a risk of gastric cancer and compared the results of our initial series with those of other procedures. METHODS: Twenty-one patients underwent a LSG/DJB from April to November . The mean preoperative weight and body mass index (BMI) were kg and kg/m(), respectively. High risks of gastric cancer were determined as having a Helicobacter pylori positive with atrophic change of mucosa or a family history of gastric cancer. Operations were performed with five ports. Initially, SG and dissection of posterior wall of duodenum were carried out. Subsequently, DJB was added with - cm of biliopancreatic tract and - cm of alimentally tract. DJB consisted of a jejunojejunostomy created by a linear stapler and hand sewing closure and duodenojujunostomy by hand sewing with two layers. RESULTS: A LSG/DJB was performed successfully in all patients. The mean operation time was +/- min. The weight loss and percent excess BMI loss for LSG/DJB were similar to those for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses. There was no mortality; however, one patient had leakage from a staple line of esophagogastric junction and reqiured drainage and stenting. No dumping, stenosis, marginal ulcer, or nutritional problems were observed during postoperative follow-up. All of the main comorbidities improved after this procedure. CONCLUSION: LSG/DJB is a feasible, safe, and effective procedure for the treatment of morbidly obese patients with the risk of gastric cancer."

However, it is unknown if the mechanism involves colonisation with specific or diverse microbiota secondary to gastric atrophy. DESIGN: Gastric colonisation with Altered Schaedler's flora (ASF) and Hp were correlated with pathology, immune responses and mRNA expression for proinflammatory and cancer-related genes in germ-free (GF), Hp monoassociated (mHp), restricted ASF (rASF; species), and specific pathogen-free (complex IF), hypergastrinemic INS-GAS mice months postinfection. RESULTS: Male mice cocolonised with rASFHp or IFHp developed the most severe pathology. IFHp males had the highest inflammatory responses, and % developed invasive gastrointestinal intraepithelial neoplasia (GIN). Notably, rASFHp colonisation was highest in males and % developed invasive GIN with elevated expression of inflammatory biomarkers. Lesions were less severe in females and none developed GIN. Gastritis in male rASFHp mice was accompanied by decreased Clostridum species ASF356 and Bacteroides species ASF519 colonisation and an overgrowth of Lactobacillus murinus ASF361, supporting that inflammation-driven atrophy alters the gastric niche for GI commensals. Hp colonisation also elevated expression of IL- and cancer-related genes, Ptger4 and Tgf-β, further supporting that Hp infection accelerates gastric cancer development in INS-GAS mice. CONCLUSIONS: rASFHp colonisation was sufficient for GIN development in males, and lower GIN incidence in females was associated with lower inflammatory responses and gastric commensal and Hp colonisation. Colonisation efficiency of commensals appears more important than microbial diversity and lessens the probability that specific gastrointestinal pathogens are contributing to cancer risk."

A consensus on treatment duration is lacking. PURPOSE: To summarize the benefits and harms of different durations of PPI-based triple therapy. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and proceedings of major meetings through May . STUDY SELECTION: English-language reports of randomized, controlled trials that compared duration (, , or days) of triple therapy and in which adequate testing confirmed the initial H. pylori infection and its eradication. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently extracted data on study design, treatment, number of patients enrolled and number of patients with successful eradication, disease at enrollment, testing, adverse effects, year of publication, publication format, and country. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of included studies, compared -day therapy with -day therapy, and compared -day therapy with -day therapy. Meta-analysis yielded relative risks (RRs) for eradication of (% CI, to ) for -day compared with -day amoxicillin-containing triple therapy ( studies) and (CI, to ) for -day compared with -day therapy ( studies). Meta-analysis of the studies that compared -day with -day metronidazole-containing therapy yielded an RR of (CI, to ). The -day versus -day comparisons yielded RRs of (CI, to ) for peptic ulcer disease and (CI, to ) for nonulcer dyspepsia. For the -day versus -day comparisons, the RRs were (CI, to ) and (CI, to ), respectively. The RRs for frequency of adverse events were (CI, to ) and (CI, to ) for -day therapy compared with - and -day therapy, respectively. Diarrhea and taste disturbance were the most frequently reported adverse events (%). LIMITATIONS: Subgroup analyses were limited by the few studies evaluating different drug regimens and disease at enrollment. Seventeen of the included studies had poor methodological quality or inadequate reporting. CONCLUSION: Available data suggest that extending triple therapy beyond days is unlikely to be a clinically useful strategy."

The pathobiology, natural history, and response to therapy of the diverse causes of secondary ITP differ from each other and from primary ITP, so accurate diagnosis is essential. Immune thrombocytopenia can be secondary to medications or to a concurrent disease, such as an autoimmune condition (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [APS], immune thyroid disease, or Evans syndrome), a lymphoproliferative disease (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or large granular T-lymphocyte lymphocytic leukemia), or chronic infection, eg, with Helicobacter pylori, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Response to infection may generate antibodies that cross-react with platelet antigens (HIV, H pylori) or immune complexes that bind to platelet Fcgamma receptors (HCV), and platelet production may be impaired by infection of megakaryocyte (MK) bone marrow-dependent progenitor cells (HCV and HIV), decreased production of thrombopoietin (TPO), and splenic sequestration of platelets secondary to portal hypertension (HCV). Sudden and severe onset of thrombocytopenia has been observed in children after vaccination for measles, mumps, and rubella or natural viral infections, including Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella zoster virus. This thrombocytopenia may be caused by cross-reacting antibodies and closely mimics acute ITP of childhood. Proper diagnosis and treatment of the underlying disorder, where necessary, play an important role in patient management."

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is not only the most common disorder within the pemphigoid group, but also represents the most frequent autoimmune blistering disease in general. The onset and course of BP depend on a variable interaction between predisposing and inducing factors. HLA genes are the most significant genetic predisposition factor to autoimmunity mechanisms. Many studies show an association between HLA-DQβ1* and distinct clinical pemphigoid variants. Imbalance between autoreactive T helper (Th) and T regulatory cells, toll-like receptor activation, and Th17/IL- pathway are the three possible autoimmunity triggers underlying BP. The pathomechanism of BP hinges on an autoantibody response toward structural components of the hemidesmosome (BP180 and BP230). The binding of autoantibodies leads to complement activation, recruitment of inflammatory cells, and release of proteolytic enzymes. The inflammatory cascade also may be directly triggered by activation of Th17 cells with no intervention of autoantibodies. The intervention of inducing factors in BP can be identified in no more than % of patients. Facilitating factors in genetically predisposed individuals are various (drug intake, physical agents, and viral infections). Drugs may act as triggers by either modifying the immune response or altering the antigenic properties of the epidermal basement membrane. Cases of induction of BP by physical agents (eg, radiation therapy, ultraviolet radiation, thermal or electrical burns, surgical procedures, transplants) are rare, but well-documented events. A contributing role in inducing BP has been suggested for infections, in particular human herpes virus (HHV) infections (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and HHV-), but also hepatitis B and C viruses, Helicobacter pylori, and Toxoplasma gondii. Unlike pemphigus, no dietary triggers have been suspected of being involved in the induction of BP. In all patients who have a diagnosis of BP, an environmental agent as a potential cause should always be considered, because the prompt discontinuation of it might result in rapid improvement or even cure of the disease."

Injection of CagA into gastric epithelial cells by type IV secretion leads to actin-cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell scattering. CagA has been reported to have no role in the induction of transcription factor NF-kappaB and IL-, which are crucial determinants for chronic inflammation. Here, we provide several lines of evidence showing that CagA is able to induce IL- in a time- and strain-dependent manner. We also show that by exchanging specific cagA genes, high IL--inducing H. pylori strains could be converted into low inducing strains and vice versa. Our results suggest that IL- release induced by CagA occurs via a Ras-->Raf-->Mek-->Erk-->NF-kappaB signaling pathway in a Shp-- and c-Met-independent manner. Thus, CagA is a multifunctional protein capable of effecting both actin remodeling and potentiation of chemokine release."

Helical shape of the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori may facilitate penetration of the thick gastric mucus where it replicates. We identified four genes required for helical shape: three LytM peptidoglycan endopeptidase homologs (csd1-) and a ccmA homolog. Surrounding the cytoplasmic membrane of most bacteria, the peptidoglycan (murein) sacculus is a meshwork of glycan strands joined by peptide crosslinks. Intact cells and isolated sacculi from mutants lacking any single csd gene or ccmA formed curved rods and showed increased peptidoglycan crosslinking. Quantitative morphological analyses of multiple-gene deletion mutants revealed each protein uniquely contributes to a shape-generating pathway. This pathway is required for robust colonization of the stomach in spite of normal directional motility. Our findings suggest that the coordinated action of multiple proteins relaxes peptidoglycan crosslinking, enabling helical cell curvature and twist."

However, in the absence of screening, patients present with advanced disease, and prognosis is poor. We conducted a cost utility analysis to determine whether endoscopic screening for stomach cancer in intermediate-risk population would be cost-effective and to better define the high-risk groups in the population who would benefit from such strategy. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by using a Markov Model. Simulation was performed on Singapore (intermediate-risk) population and various high-risk subgroups. Comparison was made between -yearly endoscopic mass screening program versus no screening. Data sources were extracted from relevant studies published from - identified via systematic PUBMED search. Main outcome measures were deaths caused by stomach cancer averted, cost per life saved, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. RESULTS: Screening of high-risk group of Chinese men (age-standardized rate, /,) from - years old is highly cost-effective, with cost benefit of United States $, per QALY. Screening this cohort of , subjects prevents stomach cancer deaths and saves absolute life years. Cost of averting cancer death is United States $,. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to incidence of stomach cancer and cost of screening endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Screening of stomach cancer in moderate to high-risk population subgroups is cost-effective. Targeted screening strategies for stomach cancer should be explored."

The cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) protein of H. pylori, which is delivered into gastric epithelial cells via bacterial type IV secretion, is an oncoprotein that can induce malignant neoplasms in mammals. Upon delivery, CagA perturbs multiple host signaling pathways by acting as an extrinsic scaffold or hub protein. On one hand, signals aberrantly raised by CagA are integrated into a direct oncogenic insult, whereas on the other hand, they engender genetic instability. Despite its decisive role in the development of gastric cancer, CagA is not required for the maintenance of a neoplastic phenotype in established cancer cells. Therefore, CagA-conducted gastric carcinogenesis progresses through a hit-and-run mechanism in which pro-oncogenic actions of CagA are successively taken over by a series of genetic and/or epigenetic alterations compiled in cancer-predisposing cells during long-standing infection with cagA-positive H. pylori."

It positively influences human health, but in vivo data describing vitamin D effects on the human gut microbiome are missing. We aimed to investigate the effects of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on the human mucosa-associated and stool microbiome as well as CD8(+) T cells in healthy volunteers. METHODS: This was an interventional, open-label, pilot study. Sixteen healthy volunteers ( females, males) were endoscopically examined to access a total of sites. We sampled stomach, small bowel, colon, and stools before and after weeks of vitamin D3 supplementation. Bacterial composition was assessed by pyrosequencing the 16S rRNA gene (V1-), and CD8(+) T cell counts were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Vitamin D3 supplementation changed the gut microbiome in the upper GI tract (gastric corpus, antrum, and duodenum). We found a decreased relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria including Pseudomonas spp. and Escherichia/Shigella spp. and increased bacterial richness. No major changes occurred in the terminal ileum, appendiceal orifice, ascending colon, and sigmoid colon or in stools, but the CD8(+) T cell fraction was significantly increased in the terminal ileum. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D3 modulates the gut microbiome of the upper GI tract which might explain its positive influence on gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease or bacterial infections. The local effects of vitamin D demonstrate pronounced regional differences in the response of the GI microbiome to external factors, which should be considered in future studies investigating the human microbiome."
