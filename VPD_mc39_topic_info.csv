Gastric cancer (GC) is a globally prevalent malignancy with a particularly heavy burden in China. Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) is a Group I carcinogen for GC, with a higher seroprevalence rate indicating a higher GC incidence. However, only approximately % of the individuals with H. pylori infection eventually develop GC, and about % still progress to GC even - years after the eradication of H. pylori . Thus, the pathogenic mechanism of H. pylori for GC must be elucidated, and high-risk individuals precisely identified. Furthermore, GC can occur even in individuals who have never been infected with H. pylori . As H. pylori infection rates decline, the proportion of H. pylori -negative GC cases is increasing annually, gaining significant research attention. In this review, potential pathogenic mechanisms of H. pylori infection are explored from the aspects of H. pylori virulence factors and host factors (genetic susceptibility and immune microenvironment). Possible risk factors for H. pylori -negative GC include infections by other microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, fungi, and viruses), autoimmune gastritis, bile reflux, genetic mutations, and environmental factors. We aim to review the potential mechanisms for GC with varying H. pylori infection statuses, identify the high-risk individuals, and pose questions that need to be addressed. In the future, as the prevalence of H. pylori infection gradually decreases, GC prevention and management must evolve to address host-specific factors and the growing challenge of H. pylori -negative GC by integrating multidisciplinary perspectives.', 'Comparison of vonoprazan bismuth-containing triple therapy with quadruple therapy in Helicobacter pylori-infected treatment-naive patients: a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial.. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Helicobacter pylori infection is linked to various gastrointestinal conditions, such as chronic active gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. Traditional treatment options encounter difficulties due to antibiotic resistance and adverse effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness of a new treatment plan that combines vonoprazan (VPZ), amoxicillin, and bismuth for the eradication of H. pylori. METHODS: A total of patients infected with H. pylori were recruited for this multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients treated for H. pylori elimination were randomly assigned at a : ratio to receive days of vonoprazan-based triple therapy (vonoprazan + amoxicillin + bismuth, group A) or standard quadruple therapy (esomeprazole + clarithromycin + amoxicillin + bismuth, group B). Compliance and adverse effects were tracked through daily medication and side effect records. All patients underwent a 13C/14C-urea breath test weeks after treatment completion. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses revealed no substantial differences in H. pylori eradication rates between groups A and B (ITT: % vs %; PP: % vs %). However, significant differences were observed in the assessment of side effects (% vs %, P < ). Specifically, group A had significantly fewer ""bitter mouths"" than group B did (% vs %, P < ). CONCLUSION: Triple therapy comprising vonoprazan ( mg), amoxicillin ( mg), and bismuth potassium citrate ( mg) achieved a PP eradication rate ≥%, paralleling standard quadruple therapy, and had fewer adverse events and lower costs (¥ vs ¥) for treatment-naive patients.', 'Eradication rate and adherence with high-dose amoxicillin and proton pump inhibitor as first-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection: Experience from University Hospital in Chile.. INTRODUCTION: In Chile, more than % of adults are infected by Helicobacter pylori. Clarithromycin should not be used in any regimen if there is >% resistance to this antibiotic, being greater than % in our population. In this scenario, the effectiveness of triple therapy (proton pump inhibitor [PPI], clarithromycin, amoxicillin) was only %. AIM: To evaluate the eradication rate and safety of dual therapy (esomeprazole and amoxicillin) in high doses, through a prospective, observational, and descriptive study. METHODS: Patients with a positive urease test obtained in an upper digestive endoscopy were included. Any other previous H. pylori eradication regimen were excluded. All patients were treated with esomeprazole mg three times a day and amoxicillin mg four times a day for days. The eradication rate of the dual therapy was evaluated with the H. pylori stool antigen test (the Pylori-Strip® test used) weeks after completing the eradication treatment and with at least days without PPI, being a negative result, confirmation of the effectiveness of this regimen. RESULTS: Of patients, had a negative H. pylori antigen in stool; The intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis, the eradication rates were % [% CI: %-%] and % [% CI: %-%], respectively. Four patients discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. Smoking and adherence to treatment were associated with eradication rate. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with H. pylori infection, high-dose dual therapy has a high eradication rate and good adherence, raising the possibility that it could be used as first-line therapy in our country. Studies with a larger number of patients should confirm these results.']",the; that; of; to; in; and; by; is; protein; as,Outliers

With the rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, the failure rate of the standard triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection is increasing. Sequential therapy and concomitant therapy have been recommended to replace standard triple therapy for H. pylori eradication in regions with high clarithromycin resistance. The aim of this prospective, randomized, and controlled study was to simultaneously assess the efficacies of -day sequential and -day concomitant therapies versus a -day standard triple therapy for treating H. pylori infection. Consecutive H. pylori-infected subjects were randomly assigned to a -day standard triple therapy (pantoprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin for days), a -day sequential therapy (pantoprazole and amoxicillin for days, followed by pantoprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole for a further days), or a -day quadruple therapy (pantoprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole for days). H. pylori status was confirmed weeks after therapy. Three hundred seven H. pylori-infected participants were randomized to receive triple (n = ), sequential (n = ), or concomitant (n = ) therapies. The eradication rates by an intention-to-treat analysis in the three treatment groups were % (% confidence interval [CI], % to %), % (% CI, % to %), and % (% CI, % to %). The seven-day concomitant therapy had a higher eradication rate than did the -day triple therapy (difference, %; % CI, % to %). There were no significant differences in the eradication rates between the sequential and standard triple therapies. All three treatments exhibited similar frequencies of adverse events (%, %, and %, respectively) and drug compliance (%, %, and %, respectively). In conclusion, the seven-day concomitant therapy is superior to the -day standard triple therapy for H. pylori eradication. Additionally, it is less complex than the -day sequential therapy because the drugs are not changed halfway through the treatment course. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT1769365.).', 'Randomised clinical trial: a comparative study of 10-day sequential therapy with 7-day standard triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection in naïve patients.. BACKGROUND: The eradication rates following standard triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection are declining worldwide. Recent studies have shown that sequential therapy for H. pylori infection yields high cure rates. AIM: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of a sequential regimen as first-line treatment of H. pylori infection with a standard triple regimen. METHODS: A total of naïve H. pylori-infected patients from six hospitals in Korea were assigned randomly to standard triple or sequential therapy groups. Standard triple therapy consisted of mg of rabeprazole, g of amoxicillin and mg of clarithromycin, twice daily for days. Sequential therapy consisted of a -day dual therapy ( mg of rabeprazole and g of amoxicillin, twice daily) followed by a -day triple therapy ( mg of rabeprazole, mg of clarithromycin, and mg of metronidazole, twice daily). RESULTS: The intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) eradication rates were % (% CI -%) and % (% CI -%) in the standard triple group, and % (% CI -%) and % (% CI -%) in the sequential group, respectively. The eradication rate was significantly higher in the sequential group compared with the standard triple group in both the ITT and PP populations (P = and P = respectively), whereas the incidence of adverse events was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Ten-day sequential therapy is more effective and equally tolerated for eradication of H. pylori infection compared with standard triple therapy. Sequential therapy may have a role as first-line treatment for H. pylori infection.', '[Effectiveness of 10 day-sequential therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication in Korea].. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Antibiotic resistance and poor compliance are the main causes of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication failure. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy is the most preferred regimen in clinical practice. However, a critical fall in the H. pylori eradication rate has been observed in the recent years. A novel day-sequential therapy consists of five days of dual therapy followed by five days of triple therapy regimen has recently been described. We aimed to evaluate whether day-sequential therapy eradicated H. pylori infection better than the PPI-based triple therapy in Korea. METHODS: patients with proven H. pylori infection were randomized to receive either day-sequential therapy ( mg of omeprazole, g of amoxicillin, each administered twice daily for the first days, followed by mg of omeprazole, mg of clarithromycin, mg of metronidazole, each administered twice daily for the remaining days) or PPI-based triple therapy ( mg of omeprazole, g of amoxicillin, mg of clarithromycin, each administered twice daily for week). Outcome of eradication therapy was assessed weeks after the cessation of treatment. RESULTS: Eradication rates of day-sequential therapy and PPI-based triple therapy were % (/) and % (/) by intention to treat analysis, respectively (p=). By per protocol analysis, eradication rates of day-sequential therapy and triple therapy were % (/) and % (/), respectively (p=). There were no significant differences in adverse event rates and treatment compliance between two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The day-sequential therapy regimen failed to achieve significantly higher eradication rates than PPI-based triple therapy.']",therapy; eradication; treatment; triple; sequential; regimens; rate; firstline; rates; regimen,therapy · eradication · treatment

Merr. et Perry.. Cleistocalyx operculatus flower buds have been widely used in traditional medicine because of their rich content of bioactive constituents. In this study, we obtained seven solvent extracts from the flower buds and evaluated their total phenolic (TPC), flavonoid (TFC), tannin (TTC), triterpenoid saponin (TSC), and alkaloid (TAC) contents. We assessed antioxidant activities using the DPPH assay and also looked at antimicrobial and enzyme inhibitory effects. The water extract possessed the highest TPC ( mg GAE/g extract), followed by ethanol, methanol, and hexane extracts (- mg GAE/g extract). Chloroform, butanol, ethyl acetate, and ethanol extracts had high TSCs (- mg OAE/g extract). The hexane extract was richest in TTC and TFC ( mg CE/g extract and mg QE/g extract, respectively). Ethanol and methanol extracts exhibited the strongest antioxidant activities (IC50 values of and μg/ml, respectively), followed by the water extract (IC50 of μg/ml). The hexane extract displayed the most growth-inhibitory activity against Helicobacter pylori ATCC51932 and ATCC43504 strains and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC13311 (MIC values of , , and mg/ml, respectively). Moreover, the hexane extract revealed the strongest inhibition of H. pylori urease activity (IC50 of μg/ml), whereas the water and methanol extracts had potent inhibitory effects on α-glucosidase activity (IC50 values of and μg/ml, respectively). These flower bud extracts could be used for health protection, especially in preventing bacterial infections and inhibiting enzymes associated with various human diseases. Further investigation into the application of C. operculatus flower buds in the food and pharmaceutical industries is necessary.', 'Influence of In Vitro Gastric Digestion of Olive Leaf Extracts on Their Bioactive Properties against H. pylori.. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of in vitro gastric digestion of two olive leaf extracts (E1 and E2) on their chemical composition and bioactive properties against Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), one of the most successful and prevalent human pathogens. HPLC-PAD/MS analysis and anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities of both olive leaf extracts were carried out before and after their in vitro gastric digestion. The results showed that gastric digestion produced modifications of the chemical composition and bioactive properties of both olive leaf extracts. The main compounds in the extract E1 were hydroxytyrosol and its glucoside derivatives (, mg/ g), presenting all the identified compounds a more polar character than those found in the E2 extract. E2 showed a higher concentration of less polar compounds than E1 extract, with oleuropein (, mg/ g) being the major component. Gastric digestion during the fasted state (pH ) induced an overall decrease of the most identified compounds. In the extract E1, while the anti-inflammatory capacity showed only a slight decrease (% of IL- production), the antioxidant properties suffered a drastic drop (% of ROS inhibition), as well as the antibacterial capacity. However, in the extract E2, these changes caused an increase in the anti-inflammatory (% of IL- production) and antioxidant activity (% of ROS inhibition), which could be due to the hydrolysis of oleuropein and ligustroside into their main degradation products, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, but the antibacterial activity was reduced. Gastric digestion during fed state (pH ) had less influence on the composition of the extracts, affecting in a lesser degree their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity, although there was a decrease in the antibacterial activity in both extracts similar to that observed at pH .', 'Inhibitory and bactericidal potential of crude acetone extracts of Combretum molle (Combretaceae) on drug-resistant strains of Helicobacter pylori.. Infection with Helicobacter pylori is strongly associated with a number of gastroduodenal pathologies. Antimicrobial resistance to commonly-used drugs has generated a considerable interest in the search for novel therapeutic compounds from medicinal plants. As an ongoing effort of this search, the susceptibility of clinical strains of H. pylori and a reference strain-NCTC ,-was evaluated against five solvent extracts of Combretum molle, a plant widely used for the treatment of gastric ulcers and other stomach-related morbidities in South Africa. The extracts were screened for activity by the agar-well diffusion method, and the most active one of them was tested against the same strains by micro-broth dilution and time kill assays. Metronidazole and amoxicillin were included in these experiments as positive control antibiotics. The solvent extracts all demonstrated anti-H. pylori activity with zone diameters of inhibition between and mm. The most potent anti-H. pylori activity was demonstrated by the acetone extract, to which % of the clinical strains were susceptible. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values for this extract ranged from to mg/mL while those for amoxicillin and metronidazole ranged from to mg/mL and from to mg/mL respectively. The acetone extract was highly bactericidal at a concentration of and mg/mL, with complete elimination of the test organisms in hours. Its inhibitory activity was better than that of metronidazole (p<) as opposed to amoxicillin (p<). The results demonstrate that C. molle may contain therapeutically-useful compounds against H. pylori, which are mostly concentrated in the acetone extract.']",activity; against; compounds; extract; extracts; antibacterial; mic; gml; inhibitory; vitro,activity · against · compounds

BACKGROUND: The clinical features and clinical course of Helicobacter pylori-negative gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma are unclear and a treatment strategy has not yet been established. AIM: To clarify the clinical differences between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphoma, we compared these two types of gastric MALT lymphoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with localized gastric MALT lymphoma were studied. H. pylori infection was present in and absent in . Treatment consisted of antibiotic therapy and/or Gy radiation therapy. Response assessment was performed every - months by esophagogastroduodenoscopy including gathering biopsy samples, endoscopic ultrasonography, clinical examination, and various imaging procedures. The median follow-up period was months. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphoma patients in terms of sex, age, stage, gross phenotype, affected area of the stomach, or the presence of monoclonality. Complete regression was achieved with antibiotic therapy against H. pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphoma in one of nine patients (%), compared to of patients (%) with H. pylori-positive gastric MALT lymphoma (p < .). Radiation therapy showed high effectiveness for the local control of H. pylori-negative or antibiotic-resistant gastric MALT lymphoma (%), although distant recurrence was recognized in three of patients (%). Two of patients (%) with H. pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphoma died because of the transformation of the disease into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. There was a significant difference in both the overall and cause-specific survival rate between the two groups (p = .). CONCLUSION: Radiation therapy is the effective treatment for H. pylori-negative or antibiotic-resistant localized gastric MALT lymphoma. However, careful systemic follow-up for distant involvement should be required. Transformation into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is thought to be the important cause of death in patients with gastric MALT lymphoma.', 'Diagnosis and Treatment for Gastric Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma.. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, which was first reported in , shows an indolent clinical course. However, the detailed clinicopathological characteristics of gastric MALT lymphoma have not been fully elucidated. We performed a literature search concerning the clinical features and treatment for gastric MALT lymphoma using PubMED. MALT lymphomas develop in single or multiple extranodal organs, of which the stomach is one of the most frequent sites; gastric MALT lymphoma accounts for % to % of all B-cell lymphomas, and % to % of primary gastric lymphomas. The eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the first-line treatment for patients with gastric MALT lymphoma, regardless of the clinical stage. Approximately -% of cases with stage I/II1 disease only achieve a complete histological response via H. pylori eradication. In patients who do not respond to H. pylori eradication therapy, second-line treatments such as watch-and-wait, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, rituximab immunotherapy, and/or a combination of these are recommended. Thus, H. pylori plays a causative role in the pathogenesis of gastric MALT lymphoma, and H. pylori eradication leads to complete histological remission in the majority of cases.', 'Clinical course of duodenal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma: Comparison with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.. BACKGROUND AND AIM: There are few cases of duodenal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma reported in the literature, and little is known about the clinical course of this disease. Here, we aimed to characterize the clinical features of duodenal MALT lymphoma by comparison with gastric MALT lymphoma. METHODS: Thirteen patients diagnosed with duodenal MALT lymphoma at Asan Medical Center from March to February were included in this retrospective study, along with patients with gastric MALT lymphoma, matched by age and sex at a : ratio. RESULTS: Median age of patients with duodenal MALT lymphoma was (range -) years, and % (/) were male. Comparison of patient characteristics indicated that Helicobacter pylori infection (% vs %, P < ) and lymph node metastasis (% vs %, P = ) rates differed between patients with duodenal and gastric MALT lymphoma. Overall complete remission (% vs %, P = ) and complete remission after initial H. pylori eradication therapy (% vs %, P = ) were significantly lower in patients with duodenal than gastric MALT lymphoma. Complications including bleeding, stricture, and transformation to high-grade lymphoma occurred in a total of seven patients (%), with a higher incidence in patients with duodenal than gastric MALT lymphoma (% vs %, P < ).

Gastric cancer remains the fourth most prevalent cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. The predominant form of gastric cancer is adenocarcinoma, which originates from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. The major risk factors for gastric cancer include diet, individual genetic variation, and, most importantly, infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Certain strains of H. pylori assisted by some of its virulence factors seem to play a critical role in gastric cancer development. Several of these H. pylori virulence factors, which influence cellular proliferation signaling, have been identified. In addition, changes in the expression of several cell proliferation regulating genes accompany or cause the progression of gastric cancer. These changes include modifications of cell cycle regulators, oncogene activation, tumor suppressor inactivation, and miRNA profile alterations. Many of these changes result from H. pylori infection, although their impact on the cellular proliferation system underlying gastric cancer development has not yet been fully elucidated. We review certain features of gastric cancer, the role of H. pylori infection in its etiology and pathogenesis, and gene expression changes during gastric carcinogenesis.', 'Role of the tumor microenvironment in the pathogenesis of gastric carcinoma.. Gastric carcinoma (GC) is the (th) most prevalent cancer and has the (nd) highest cancer-related mortality rate worldwide. Despite the incidence of GC has decreased over the past few decades, it is still a serious health problem. Chronic inflammatory status of the stomach, caused by the infection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and through the production of inflammatory mediators within the parenchyma is suspected to play an important role in the initiation and progression of GC. In this review, the correlation between chronic inflammation and H. pylori infection as an important factor for the development of GC will be discussed. Major components, including tumor-associated macrophages, lymphocytes, cancer-associated fibroblasts, angiogenic factors, cytokines, and chemokines of GC microenvironment and their mechanism of action on signaling pathways will also be discussed. Increasing our understanding of how the components of the tumor microenvironment interact with GC cells and the signaling pathways involved could help identify new therapeutic and chemopreventive targets.', 'Molecular pathology of gastric carcinoma.. Gastric carcinoma (GC) is a biologically heterogeneous disease involving numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations. A very small proportion of GCs can be caused by a specific germ-line mutation of the E-cadherin gene (CDH1). Sporadic GC is developed through multistep processes that begin with Helicobacter pylori-induced atrophic gastritis. Epstein-Barr virus is another infectious cause of GC, and the above two infection-associated GCs are characterized by global CpG island methylation in the promoter region of cancer-related genes. Mutations of tumor protein p53 (TP53) and β-catenin (CTNNB1) genes occur early in the development of GC and contribute to gastric carcinogenesis. Furthermore, significant numbers of GCs show loss of Runx3 due to hemizygous deletion and hypermethylation of the promoter region. Aberrant Cdx2 expression has been shown in precancerous lesions as well as GC. However, it remains unclear whether Cdx2 plays an oncogenic role in gastric carcinogenesis. GC with microsatellite instability is also a well-defined subset exhibiting distinctive clinicopathologic features. Targeted therapy against GC with ERBB2 amplification recently improved the prognosis of patients with advanced GC. In addition, epigenetic changes in GC could be attractive targets for cancer treatment with modulators. A genome-wide search has been undertaken to identify novel methylation-silenced genes in GC, which will help us understand the overall molecular features of GC and further provide novel opportunities in the treatment of GC.']",gc; cancer; expression; tumor; gastric; cells; cell; progression; in; tissues,cancer · expression · tumor

Helicobacter pylori infection in children differs from that in adults, from the point of view of epidemiology, host response, clinical features, related diseases, and diagnosis, as well as treatment strategies. The prevalence of H. pylori infection, in both children and adults, is decreasing in the Western World as well as in some developing countries, which contrasts with the increase in childhood asthma and allergic diseases. Recurrent abdominal pain is not specific during H. pylori infection in children. The role of H. pylori infection and failure to thrive, children's growth, type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and celiac disease remains controversial. The main initial diagnosis is based on upper digestive endoscopy with biopsy-based methods. Nodular gastritis may be a pathognomonic endoscopic finding of childhood H. pylori infection. The infection eradication control is based on validated noninvasive tests. The main cause of treatment failure of H. pylori infection is its clarithromycin resistance. We recommend standard antibiotic susceptibility testing of H. pylori in pediatric patients prior to the initiation of eradication therapy. H. pylori treatment in children should be based on an evaluation of the rate of eradication in the local population, a systematic use of a treatment adapted to the susceptibility profile and a treatment compliance greater than %. The last meta-analysis in children did not show an advantage for sequential therapy when compared to a -day triple therapy.

However, the major route of transmission remains poorly understood. The prevalence of H. pylori infection continues to vary markedly between developing countries and developed countries, and according to ethnicity, place of birth and socioeconomic factors among people living in the same country. According to the nation-wide seroprevalence study for , asymptomatic Korean population, which was conducted from March to October , the seroprevalence of H. pylori infection was %, showing the transition from a developing country to a developed country.

The annual family income level was shown to be positively correlated with the risk of H. pylori infection. The prevalence of H. pylori infection was also associated with family size, education level, and several diet-related factors, such as the number of times cooked rice and potatoes eaten per week, and a family history of stomach diseases. Compared to nonsymptomatic individuals, people with dyspeptic symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and belching) presented a low prevalence of H. pylori infection. No association between H. pylori prevalence and smoking or drinking was found. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, annual family income and education level were the independent predictors for H. pylori infection.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of H. pylori cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin gene A (vacA) genes and their genotypes in patients with gastrointestinal diseases. Methods Patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal disease based on endoscopic findings were recruited for the study. Gastric biopsies were collected to screen for H. pylori infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Subsequently, infected samples were tested for cagAand vacA genes, and their genotypes were analyzed by sequencing. Results Among cases, % (/) exhibited gastrointestinal diseases. Of these cases, % (/) were infected with H. pylori. Regarding gene detection, (%) samples were positive for cagA, while all samples were positive for vacA. For cagA, the Western type with the ABC pattern was the most prominent. There was a statistically significant association between cagA genotypes and clinical outcomes, with the Western type being more prevalent in gastritis patients. For vacA, there was a high prevalence of the s1 and i1, while the m1 and m2 showed similar prevalence. In our combined analysis, the dominant vacA genotype combinations were s1m1i1 (%). There were no statistical differences between the vacA genotypes and clinical outcomes (P > ). Conclusion This study revealed a high prevalence of H. pylori cagA and vacA genes, but there were variations in their genotypes. A correlation was observed between the Western-type cagA and gastritis; however, no association was found between vacA genotypes and clinical outcomes.', 'Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori vacA, cagA and iceA genotypes in South African patients with upper gastrointestinal diseases..

The aim of the present study was to delineate the therapeutic effect of a Helicobacter pylori vaccine with chitosan as an adjuvant, as well as to identify the potential mechanism against H. pylori infection when compared with an H. pylori vaccine, with cholera toxin (CT) as an adjuvant. Mice were first infected with H. pylori and, following the establishment of an effective infection model, were vaccinated using an H. pylori protein vaccine with chitosan as an adjuvant. Levels of H. pylori colonization, H. pylori‑specific antibodies and cytokines were determined by enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. The TLR4 and Foxp3 mRNA and protein levels were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. It was identified that the H. pylori elimination rate of the therapeutic vaccine with chitosan as an adjuvant (%) was greater than the therapeutic vaccine with CT as an adjuvant (%). The therapeutic H. pylori vaccine with chitosan as an adjuvant induced significantly greater antibody and cytokine levels when compared with the control groups. Notably, the IL‑ and IL‑ levels in the groups with chitosan as an adjuvant to the H. pylori vaccine were significantly greater than those in the groups with CT as an adjuvant. The mRNA expression levels of TLR4 and Foxp3 were significantly elevated in the mice that were vaccinated with chitosan as an adjuvant to the H. pylori vaccine, particularly in mice where the H. pylori infection had been eradicated. The H. pylori vaccine with chitosan as an adjuvant effectively increased the H. pylori elimination rate, the humoral immune response and the Th1/Th2 cell immune reaction; in addition, the therapeutic H. pylori vaccine regulated the Th1 and Th2 response. The significantly increased TLR4 expression and decreased CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Treg cell number contributed to the immune clearance of the H. pylori infection. Thus, the present findings demonstrate that in mice the H. pylori vaccine with chitosan as an adjuvant exerts an equivalent immunotherapeutic effect on H. pylori infection when compared with the H. pylori vaccine with CT as an adjuvant.', 'Systemic immunization with an epitope-based vaccine elicits a Th1-biased response and provides protection against Helicobacter pylori in mice.. Vaccine-mediated Th1-biased CD4+ T cell responses have been shown to be crucial for protection against Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). In this study, we investigated whether a vaccine composed of CD4+ T cell epitopes together with Th1 adjuvants could confer protection against H. pylori in a mouse model. We constructed an epitope-based vaccine, designated Epivac, which was composed of predicted immunodominant CD4+ T cell epitopes from H. pylori adhesin A (HpaA), urease B (UreB) and cytotoxin-associated gene A product (CagA). Together with four different Th1 adjuvants, Epivac was administered subcutaneously and the prophylactic potential was examined. Compared to non-immunized mice, immunization with Epivac alone or with a Th1 adjuvant significantly reduced H. pylori colonization, and better protection was observed when an adjuvant was used. Immunized mice exhibited a strong local and systemic Th1-biased immune response, which may contribute to the inhibition of H. pylori colonization. Though a significant specific antibody response was induced by the vaccine, no correlation was found between the intensity of the humoral response and the protective effect. Our results suggest that a vaccine containing CD4+ T cell epitopes is a promising candidate for protection against H. pylori infection.', ""Advances in Helicobacter pylori vaccine research: From candidate antigens to adjuvants-A review.. BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative, spiral-shaped bacterium that infects approximately % of the world's population and has been strongly associated with chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoma, and gastric cancer. The elimination of H. pylori is currently considered one of the most effective strategies for the treatment of gastric-related diseases, so antibiotic therapy is the most commonly used regimen for the treatment of H. pylori infection. Although this therapy has some positive effects, antibiotic resistance has become another clinically prominent problem. Therefore, the development of a safe and efficient vaccine has become an important measure to prevent H. pylori infection. METHODS: PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched from January to March with search terms-H. pylori vaccine, adjuvants, immunization, pathogenesis, and H. pylori eradication in the title and/or abstract of literature. A total of documents were obtained. Based on the principles of academic reliability, authority, nearly publicated, and excluded the similar documents, finally, documents were selected, organized, and analyzed. RESULTS: Most of the candidate antigens used as H. pylori vaccines in these literatures are whole-cell antigens and virulence antigens such as UreB, VacA, CagA, and HspA, and the main types of vaccines for H. pylori are whole bacteria vaccines, vector vaccines, subunit vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines, epitope vaccines, etc. Some vaccines have shown good immune protection in animal trials; however, few vaccines show good in clinical trials. The only H. pylori vaccine passed phase clinical trial is a recombinant subunit vaccine using Urease subunit B (UreB) as the vaccine antigen, and it shows good prophylactic effects. Meanwhile, the adjuvant system for vaccines against this bacterium has been developed considerably. In addition to the traditional mucosal adjuvants such as cholera toxin (CT) and E. coli heat labile enterotoxin (LT), there are also promising safer and more effective mucosal adjuvants. All these advances made safe and effective H. pylori vaccines come into service as early as possible. CONCLUSIONS: This review briefly summarized the advances of H. pylori vaccines from two aspects, candidates of antigens and adjuvants, to provide references for the development of vaccine against this bacterium. We also present our prospects of exosomal vaccines in H. pylori vaccine research, in the hope of inspiring future researchers.""]",vaccine; vaccines; mice; against; recombinant; immunization; vaccination; protection; immune; adjuvant,vaccine · vaccines · mice

Amoxicillin mucoadhesive microspheres containing chitosan as mucoadhesive polymer were prepared by simple emulsification phase separation technique using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent. Results of preliminary trials indicate that volume of cross-linking agent, time for cross-linking, polymer-to-drug ratio, and speed of rotation affected characteristics of microspheres. Microspheres were discrete, spherical, free flowing and also showed high percentage drug entrapment efficiency. In vitro mucoadhesive test showed that amoxicillin mucoadhesive microspheres adhered more strongly to gastric mucous layer and could retain in gastrointestinal tract for an extended period of time. A () full factorial design was employed to study the effect of independent variables, polymer-to-drug ratio (X()), and stirring speed (X()) on dependent variables i.e. percentage mucoadhesion, t(), drug entrapment efficiency, particle size and swelling index.

RESULTS: A total of patients were included in this study. The sequence of H. pylori eradication and peptic ulcer disease treatment did not significantly affect the outcomes of H. pylori eradication and peptic ulcer disease healing. In addition, patient age, peptic ulcer disease type, clinic type and treatment regimen (including choice of proton pump inhibitor) had no significant impact on H. pylori eradication. However, patient gender and the choice of antibiotic combination proved to be key factors, as eradication rates were lower in female patients compared to males, and the combination of levofloxacin and clarithromycin was the least effective in eradicating H. pylori. Regarding peptic ulcer disease healing, the peptic ulcer disease type was an important influencing factor, since gastric ulcers being more likely to get cured completely compared to duodenal ulcers. CONCLUSIONS: The sequence of H. pylori eradication and peptic ulcer disease treatment does not significantly affect the primary outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is a heterogeneous malignant disease associated with environmental and genetic predisposing factors. While gastric cancer incidence and mortality fell greatly globally over the past decades, it remains the fourth cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Thus, prevention of gastric cancer is still a major strategy for improvement of gastric cancer prognosis. SUMMARY: Helicobacter pylori infection has been demonstrated to be a major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. Unhealthy diet and lifestyle, including high-salt food, smoking and drinking, are able to induce genotypic and phenotypic transformation of gastric epithelial cells. Gene mutations (such as E-cadherin) in stomach epithelial cells are major genetic causes for gastric cancer. The eradication of H. pylori has been demonstrated to be an effective approach for primary prevention of gastric cancer. Increased intake of a diet rich in vegetables and fresh fruits as well as smoking cessation have been shown to reduce the incidence of gastric cancer. The secondary prevention strategy is to screen premalignant gastric lesions by endoscopy. Biomarker tests are also reliable methods to identify gastric precancerous lesions. Endoscopy screening is still the gold standard for diagnosis of gastric cancer. KEY MESSAGE: H. pylori infection, a diet rich in salted and/or smoked food and red meat, as well as gene mutations are major risk factors for the development of gastric cancer. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The eradication of H. pylori is a major primary preventive strategy of gastric cancer. A healthy lifestyle, including increased intake of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, reduced intake of salted and smoked food and red meat, a reduction of alcohol intake as well as smoking cessation will be effective approaches for the prevention of gastric cancer.', 'Burden of Gastric Cancer.. Gastric cancer is a global health problem, with more than million people newly diagnosed with gastric cancer worldwide each year. Despite its worldwide decline in incidence and mortality over the past decades, gastric cancer remains the third leading cause of cancer-related death. Knowledge of global as well as regional epidemiology and risk factors for gastric cancer is essential for the practicing gastroenterologist to make personalized decisions about risk stratification, screening, and prevention. In this article, we review the epidemiology of gastric cancer as well as screening and prevention efforts to reduce global morbidity and mortality from gastric cancer. First, we discuss the descriptive epidemiology of gastric cancer, including its incidence, mortality, survival, and secular trends. We combine a synthesis of published studies with an analysis of data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer GLOBOCAN project to describe the global burden of gastric cancer and data from the US Cancer Statistics registry to discuss the change in incidence of gastric cancer in the United States. Next, we summarize current knowledge of risk factors for gastric cancer. Finally, we discuss prevention strategies and screening efforts for gastric cancer.', 'Epidemiology of stomach cancer.. Despite a major decline in incidence and mortality over several decades, stomach cancer is still the fourth most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death in the world. There is a -fold variation in incidence between populations at the highest and lowest risk. The incidence is particularly high in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and parts of Central and South America, and it is about twice as high among men than among women. Prognosis is generally rather poor, with -year relative survival below % in most countries. The best established risk factors for stomach cancer are Helicobacter pylori infection, the by far strongest established risk factor for distal stomach cancer, and male sex, a family history of stomach cancer, and smoking. While some factors related to diet and food preservation, such as high intake of salt-preserved foods and dietary nitrite or low intake of fruit and vegetables, are likely to increase the risk of stomach cancer, the quantitative impact of many dietary factors remains uncertain, partly due to limitations of exposure assessment and control for confounding factors. Future epidemiologic research should pay particular attention to differentiation of stomach cancer epidemiology by subsite, and to exploration of potential interactions between H. pylori infection, genetic, and environmental factors.']",cancer; incidence; risk; gastric; mortality; gc; factors; intake; prevention; dietary,cancer · incidence · risk

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection is an established risk factor for chronic atrophic gastritis. However, estimates of the strength of this association have varied widely, possibly due to clearance of the infection in severe stages of chronic atrophic gastritis, which may lead to underestimation of the association. We assessed the association of H. pylori infection with chronic atrophic gastritis according to severity of disease. METHODS: We measured serum pepsinogen I and II (as surrogates for chronic atrophic gastritis) and antibodies against H. pylori by ELISA in men and women aged - years in a population-based study in Saarland, a state of Germany. The association between H. pylori and chronic atrophic gastritis (defined as pepsinogen I < ng/mL and pepsinogen I/II-ratio <) was analyzed after stratification of chronic atrophic gastritis cases by quintiles of pepsinogen I as proxy marker for severity of chronic atrophic gastritis. RESULTS: When all cases were included, the odds ratio for the association with Chronic atrophic gastritis for H. pylori infection alone was (% confidence interval -); it was (-), for H. pylori infection that was positive for the presence of Ig G antibodies specific to the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) protein-a well-established virulence factor of H. pylori.

Five of cases with CagA-seropositivity but negative H. pylori serostatus (a pattern indicative of past infection) were in the group of most severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis of major underestimation of the association of H. pylori and chronic atrophic gastritis, due to clearance of the infection in advanced stages of the disease.

The prevalence of glandular atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and Hp infection was , and %. Complete and incomplete metaplasia was found to be and %. The mean score of chronic inflammation, neutrophil activity, glandular atrophy, and intestinal metaplasia was significantly higher in the antrum than in the corpus. The positivity of gastritis increases with age; however, Hp positivity decreased considerably with advanced age. Concerning gastritis's topography, antral-predominant gastritis and corpus-predominant gastritis increased with age. The prevalence of glandular atrophy and intestinal metaplasia markedly increased with age, especially after age .

Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a widely prevalent problem in pediatrics, reportedly occurring in % to % of children and accounting for considerable impact on quality of life and health care costs. FD is defined by the Rome III classification as persistent upper abdominal pain or discomfort, not related to bowel movements, and without an organic cause, that is present for at least months prior to diagnosis. Abnormal sensory perception, motor dysfunction, and psychosocial factors have been implicated in the causation of FD. Hypersensitivity to gastric distension, delayed gastric emptying, antral hypomotility, and gastric dysrhythmia are some abnormalities that have been noted in FD. Diagnosis of FD is based on a thorough history and examination, and an appropriate selection of tests based on clinical judgment, the presence of alarm signs, and response to treatment. A positive diagnosis of FD helps to shift focus from further testing to treatment of symptoms. The majority of children with dyspepsia do not have mucosal lesions on endoscopy; hence, endoscopy is not mandatory for the diagnosis of FD. Helicobacter pylori is an uncommon cause of dyspepsia in children, and test and treat strategy is discouraged. Delayed gastric emptying may be present in up to % of children with dyspepsia. A biopsychosocial approach to treatment involving medications, psychological and social supports, and complementary therapies is advocated. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and prokinetics are commonly used first-line medications. PPIs are preferred when epigastric pain is the predominant symptom, whereas prokinetics may be chosen when postprandial fullness or early satiety is the main symptom. PPIs may be more efficacious and cost-effective than H2 blockers according to adult data.', '[Epidemiology, classification and management of functional dyspepsia].. Functional dyspepsia belongs to functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Its prevalence is estimated up to % of adult population of Western countries. On the contrary to irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia is slightly more frequent in men. The recent classification of functional dyspepsia includes its two subcategories: postprandial distress syndrome (DS, B1a) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS, B1b). In the management of functional dyspepsia three strategies are taken into the consideration: . early gastroscopy performed in people over years of age and independent of age in case of alarm symptoms. . Therapy based on noninvasive H. pylori testing: in young adults with dyspeptic symptoms, without alarm symptoms and not treated with nonsteroid antiphlogistic medications. . Empiric treatment: considered as an initial therapy in patients not diagnosed with dyspepsia, without alarm symptoms and in dyspeptic patients despite H. pylori eradication. In the treatment of functional dyspepsia the following treatments are applied: dietary treatment, farmacotherapy with antisecretory drugs, prokinetics, H. pylori eradication, antidepressants and psychotherapy. Directions of the further investigation in functional dyspepsia include: improvement of endoscopic methods, and searching for new groups of medications according to the new Rome III classification of functional dyspepsia, based on its pathophysiology.', 'Epidemiology of uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia in Asia: facts and fiction.. Dyspepsia is a syndrome consisting of epigastric pain, burning, fullness, discomfort, early satiety, nausea, vomiting and belching. Functional dyspepsia (FD) is diagnosed if upper gastrointestinal endoscopy does not show structural abnormality explaining these symptoms. %-% and %-% of Asian people suffer from of uninvestigated dyspepsia and FD, respectively. Most patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia are found to have FD. Patients with FD are usually young and there is no predilection to any gender. Overlap of FD with other functional bowel diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease is common in Asia. Cultural difference in reporting of symptoms of dyspepsia is well-known. Moreover, dietary factors, socio-cultural and psychological issues, gastrointestinal infection including that caused by Helicobacter pylori, frequency of organic diseases such as peptic ulcer and gastric cancer responsible for dyspeptic symptoms in the study population may also influence epidemiology of dyspepsia.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: It is difficult to determine the exact incidence rate of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection-negative gastric cancer (HPIN-GC) because H. pylori detection rates decrease with the progression of gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and clinicopathologic characteristics of HPIN-GC in South Korea. METHODS: Helicobacter pylori infection status was evaluated by histology, a rapid urease test (CLO test), culturing, serology, and history of H. pylori eradication for patients with gastric cancer. Current H. pylori infection was defined as positive results from histology, the CLO test, and culturing. Previous H. pylori infection was defined as negative in all three biopsy-based tests and positive serology or history of H. pylori eradication. Patients were considered to be negative for H. pylori infection if all results from five methods were negative. However, patients who were found to have severe gastric atrophy by the serum pepsinogen test or metaplastic gastric atrophy by histology were assumed to have had a previous H. pylori infection even if results from other tests for H. pylori infection were all negative. RESULTS: The number of patients with gastric cancer with current or previous H. pylori infection was (%) and (%), respectively. The rate of HPIN-GC occurrence was % (n = ). Sex, age, Lauren type, location of the tumor, and treatment modalities were not different according to H. pylori infection status. However, HPIN-GC had a more advanced pT classification (T3/T4; vs %, p = .) and a more advanced stage (more than stage I; vs %, p = .) than H. pylori-positive gastric cancer.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested a controversial role of Helicobacter pylori infection in gastric cancer prognosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential impact of H. pylori status on the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer in a Chinese prospective cohort. METHODS: Between and , patients with curatively resected gastric cancer were enrolled in the study. H. pylori status was defined by means of immunohistochemical staining in tumour and non-neoplastic tissues. Treatment prognosis was measured in terms of cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival (dfs). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess the association between H. pylori status and patient prognosis. RESULTS: Positivity for H. pylori infection was observed in of the patients (%). In patients positive for H. pylori, mean cancer-specific survival was months [% confidence interval (ci): to months] and mean dfs was months (% ci: to months); the same survivals were, respectively, months (% ci: to months) and months (% ci: to months) in patients negative for H. pylori.

The prevalence is associated with socioeconomic conditions, with this infection being more common in developing countries than in developed countries. The presence and permanence of H. pylori in the oral cavity has been reported, but its role is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of H. pylori in dental plaque of patients with periodontitis.

RESULTS: % of the samples (n = ) were positive for the presence of H. pylori by the amplification of the 16S rRNA and vacA genes. In addition, cagA gene was detected in % (n = ) of H. pylori-positive. A significant relationship between periodontal status and H. pylori oral infection was found (P ≤ ); patients with initial and moderate periodontitis were the most affected with % and %, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the prevalence of H. pylori in the oral cavity could be related to the progression of periodontal disease. Therefore, oral hygiene and treatment for the elimination of oral H. pylori could stop the progression of periodontal disease.']",oral; dental; plaque; cavity; periodontal; periodontitis; saliva; halitosis; pylori; teeth,oral · dental · plaque

Helicobacter pylori strains produce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-inducing protein, Tipα as a carcinogenic factor in the gastric epithelium. Tipα acts as a homodimer with -kDa protein, whereas del-Tipα is an inactive monomer. H. pylori isolated from gastric cancer patients secreted large amounts of Tipα, which are incorporated into gastric cancer cells by directly binding to nucleolin on the cell surface, which is a receptor of Tipα. The binding complex induces expression of TNF-α and chemokine genes, and activates NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells). To understand the mechanisms of Tipα in tumor progression, we looked at numerous effects of Tipα on human gastric cancer cell lines. Induction of cell migration and elongation was found to be mediated through the binding to surface nucleolin, which was inhibited by the nucleolin-targeted siRNAs. Tipα induced formation of filopodia in MKN- cells, suggesting invasive morphological changes. Tipα enhanced the phosphorylation of cancer-related proteins in serine, threonine and tyrosine, indicating activation of MEK-ERK signal cascade. Although the downregulation of E-cadherin was not shown in MKN- cells, Tipα induced the expression of vimentin, a significant marker of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It is of great importance to note that Tipα reduced the Young's modulus of MKN- cells determined by atomic force microscopy: This shows lower cell stiffness and increased cell motility. The morphological changes induced in human gastric cancer cells by Tipα are significant phenotypes of EMT. This is the first report that Tipα is a new inducer of EMT, probably associated with tumor progression in human gastric carcinogenesis."", 'Helicobacter pylori promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by downregulating CK2β in gastric cancer cells.. Strains of Helicobacter pylori that are positive for the oncoprotein CagA (cytotoxin-associated gene A) are associated with gastric cancer and might be related to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Casein kinase (CK2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a major role in tumorigenesis through signaling pathways related to the EMT. However, the role played by the interaction between CagA and CK2 in gastric carcinogenesis is poorly understood. Although CK2α protein expression remained unchanged during H. pylori infection, we found that CK2α kinase activity was increased in gastric epithelial cells. We also found that the CK2β protein level decreased in H. pylori-infected gastric cancer cells in CagA-dependent manner and demonstrated that CagA induced CK2β degradation via HDM2 (human double minute ; its murine equivalent is MDM2). We observed that CagA induced HDM2 protein phosphorylation and that p53 levels were decreased in H. pylori-infected gastric cancer cells. In addition, downregulation of CK2β induced AKT Ser473 phosphorylation and decreased the AKT Ser129 phosphorylation level in gastric cancer cells. We also found that the downregulation of CK2β triggered the upregulation of Snail levels in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, our in vivo experiments and functional assays of migration and colony formation suggest that CK2β downregulation is a major factor responsible for the EMT in gastric cancer. Therefore, CK2 could be a key mediator of the EMT in H. pylori-infected gastric cancer and could serve as a molecular target for gastric cancer treatment.', 'Involvement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factors in the mechanism of Helicobacter pylori-induced fibroblasts activation.. Gastric cancer (GC) originating from the lining of the stomach is one of the most frequent malignancies in humans. The most efficient method giving hope of full recovery from GC is gastric resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, over % of patients after treatment suffer from recurrence and peritoneal metastasis. The bacteria Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is nowadays considered as the major pathogen capable of colonizing gastric mucosa. This bug causes deregulation of multiple signaling pathways including the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NFκB) and Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) responsible for inflammation and development of carcinogenic cascade. The pathomechanism of these changes remains little understood, but the Hp virulence factors affecting mainly gastric epithelium have been postulated. Nevertheless, the changes associated with inflammation progressing to cancer are not only limited to epithelial cells. The cells surrounding the tumor, mainly activated fibroblasts (CAFs - cancer-associated fibroblasts) create molecular microenvironment promoting tumorigenesis and cancer invasion. The downstream targets of STAT3, epithelial-mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factors (EMT-TFs) are expressed in activated fibroblasts providing them with additional properties. Thus, our aim was to determine if the Hp strain expressing CagA and VacA cytotoxins may result in the activation/differentiation of rat gastric fibroblasts resulting in NFκB and STAT3 signaling, which could lead to EMT-TFs expression and secretome responsible for inflammatory and EMT inducing microenvironment. In this study, gastric samples were harvested from -week-old Spraque-Dowley rats and the primary and secondary fibroblast cultures were established. The % confluent secondary fibroblast cultures were infected with x of live Hp expressing cytotoxins CagA VacA per dish and incubated in humidified atmosphere for , , and hours, before the conditioned media or the cells were used for endpoint experiments. As the control, fibroblast culture in DMEM with % FBS and antibiotics, free from Hp infection was used. The expression of mRNA for 18S (control), toll-like receptors: TLR2 and TLR4, STAT3, NFκB p65/Rel A, inhibitor of NF-κB (Iκβ), Snail and Twist was determined by RT-PCR. The protein expression of Snail and Twist was assessed by Western blot technique. The fibroblast supernatant was collected at hours from non-infected and Hp (cagA+ vacA+)-infected culture and the concentrations of interleukin (IL-), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and stromal derived factor- (SDF-) were measured by ELISA. In fibroblasts infected with Hp (cagA+ vacA+), the significant increase of mRNA expression for both, TLR2 and TLR4, as well as STAT3, NFκB/RelA subunit was observed already after hours of fibroblasts infection with Hp strain compared with control non-infected fibroblasts. Simultaneously, the significant decrease of Iκβ mRNA has been noticed starting from hours after the Hp infection of fibroblasts was carried out. The strong increase in the expression of Snail1 and Twist mRNA was recorded already at hours in Hp-infected fibroblasts comparing to control non-infected fibroblasts and this increase persisted at and hours being the most pronounced at hours post incubation with Hp. The expression of Snail1 protein was observed after hours post Hp infection and this increase persisted throughout entire time periods upon Hp infection. In contrast, no detectable level of Twist protein expression was observed up to hours post-infection neither in control conditions nor in fibroblasts co-infected with Hp. These changes in fibroblasts were accompanied by a significant increase in the release of HGF, SDF- and IL- determined in cell supernatants collected from Hp-infected fibroblasts. These data indicate that the activation/differentiation of rat gastric fibroblasts can occur directly by Hp releasing CagA and indirectly through TLR2 and TLR4 and these effects can be mediated by transcription factors NFκB and STAT3 signaling leading to rapid Snail1 protein expression. We conclude that NFκB and STAT3 signaling together with Snail1 protein expression may activate the secretome responsible for fibroblasts inflammatory and EMT-inducing microenvironment likely serving as prerequisite for GC development.']",expression; cells; cancer; gastric; gc; signaling; carcinogenesis; cell; pathway; proliferation,expression · cells · cancer

Fucosyllactoses, including '-fucosyllactose ('-FL) and -fucosyllactose (-FL), are important oligosaccharides in human milk that are commonly used as nutritional additives in infant formula due to their biological functions, such as the promotion of bifidobacteria growth, inhibition of pathogen infection, and improvement of immune response. In this study, we developed a synthetic biology approach to promote the efficient biosynthesis of '-FL and -FL in engineered Escherichia coli. To boost the production of '-FL and -FL, multiple modular optimization strategies were applied in a plug-and-play manner. First, comparisons of various exogenous α1,-fucosyltransferase and α1,-fucosyltransferase candidates, as well as a series of E. coli host strains, demonstrated that futC and futA from Helicobacter pylori using BL21(DE3) as the host strain yielded the highest titers of '-FL and -FL. Subsequently, both the availability of the lactose acceptor substrate and the intracellular pool of the GDP-L-fucose donor substrate were optimized by inactivating competitive (or repressive) pathways and strengthening acceptor (or donor) availability to achieve overproduction. Moreover, the intracellular redox regeneration pathways were engineered to further enhance the production of '-FL and -FL. Finally, various culture conditions were optimized to achieve the best performance of '-FL and -FL biosynthesizing strains. The final concentrations of '-FL and -FL were and 43g/L, respectively. This work provides a platform that enables modular construction, optimization and characterization to facilitate the development of FL-producing cell factories."", ""Construction of Escherichia coli strains with chromosomally integrated expression cassettes for the synthesis of 2'-fucosyllactose.. BACKGROUND: The trisaccharide '-fucosyllactose ('-FL) is one of the most abundant oligosaccharides found in human milk. Due to its prebiotic and anti-infective properties, '-FL is discussed as nutritional additive for infant formula. Besides chemical synthesis and extraction from human milk, '-FL can be produced enzymatically in vitro and in vivo. The most promising approach for a large-scale formation of '-FL is the whole cell biosynthesis in Escherichia coli by intracellular synthesis of GDP-L-fucose and subsequent fucosylation of lactose with an appropriate α1,-fucosyltransferase. Even though whole cell approaches have been demonstrated for the synthesis of '-FL, further improvements of the engineered E. coli host are required to increase product yields. Furthermore, an antibiotic-free method of whole cell synthesis of '-FL is desirable to simplify product purification and to avoid traces of antibiotics in a product with nutritional purpose. RESULTS: Here we report the construction of the first selection marker-free E. coli strain that produces '-FL from lactose and glycerol. To construct this strain, recombinant genes of the de novo synthesis pathway for GDP-L-fucose as well as the gene for the H. pylori fucosyltransferase futC were integrated into the chromosome of E. coli JM109 by using the λ-Red recombineering technique. Strains carrying additional copies of the futC gene and/or the gene fkp (from Bacteroides fragilis) for an additional salvage pathway for GDP-L-fucose production were used and shown to further improve production of '-FL in shake flask experiments. An increase of the intracellular GDP-L-fucose concentration by expression of fkp gene as well as an additional copy of the futC gene lead to an enhanced formation of '-FL. Using an improved production strain, feasibility of large scale '-FL production was demonstrated in an antibiotic-free fed-batch fermentation ( l) with a final '-FL concentration of ± g l(-) and a space-time-yield of g l(-) h(-). CONCLUSIONS: By chromosomal integration of recombinant genes, altering the copy number of these genes and analysis of '-FL and intracellular GDP-L-fucose levels, we were able to construct and improve the first selection marker-free E. coli strain which is capable to produce '-FL without the use of expression plasmids. Analysis of intracellular GDP-L-fucose levels identified the de novo synthesis pathway of GDP-L-fucose as one bottleneck in '-FL production. In antibiotic-free fed-batch fermentation with an improved strain, scale-up of '-FL could be demonstrated."", 'Helicobacter pylori lipopolysaccharide is synthesized via a novel pathway with an evolutionary connection to protein N-glycosylation.. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component on the surface of Gram negative bacteria and is composed of lipid A-core and the O antigen polysaccharide. O polysaccharides of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori contain Lewis antigens, mimicking glycan structures produced by human cells. The interaction of Lewis antigens with human dendritic cells induces a modulation of the immune response, contributing to the H. pylori virulence. The amount and position of Lewis antigens in the LPS varies among H. pylori isolates, indicating an adaptation to the host. In contrast to most bacteria, the genes for H. pylori O antigen biosynthesis are spread throughout the chromosome, which likely contributed to the fact that the LPS assembly pathway remained uncharacterized. In this study, two enzymes typically involved in LPS biosynthesis were found encoded in the H. pylori genome; the initiating glycosyltransferase WecA, and the O antigen ligase WaaL. Fluorescence microscopy and analysis of LPS from H. pylori mutants revealed that WecA and WaaL are involved in LPS production. Activity of WecA was additionally demonstrated with complementation experiments in Escherichia coli. WaaL ligase activity was shown in vitro. Analysis of the H. pylori genome failed to detect a flippase typically involved in O antigen synthesis. Instead, we identified a homolog of a flippase involved in protein N-glycosylation in other bacteria, although this pathway is not present in H. pylori. This flippase named Wzk was essential for O antigen display in H. pylori and was able to transport various glycans in E. coli. Whereas the O antigen mutants showed normal swimming motility and injection of the toxin CagA into host cells, the uptake of DNA seemed to be affected.

Objective: The present study was conducted to evaluate invasive and noninvasive diagnostic methods for detection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in patients admitted with dyspeptic complaints and to compare sensitivities and specificities. Method: Sets of four gastric biopsy specimens were obtained from a total of patients included in the study. The presence of H. pylori was determined by invasive tests including culture, rapid urease test, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and histopathology. Among noninvasive tests, urea breath test, serological tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed. Results: H. pylori was isolated in (%) gastric biopsy cultures, whereas positivity was concluded for (%) patients by rapid urease test, for (%) by PCR, for (%) by histopathology, for (%) by urea breath test, and for (%) by ELISA. In the present study, the culture findings and histopathological examination findings were accepted as gold standard. According to the gold standard, urea breath test had the highest sensitivity (%) and the lowest specificity (%), whereas culture and histopathology had the highest specificities (%). Conclusion: The use of PCR invasively with gastric biopsy samples yielded parallel results with the gold standard. PCR can be recommended for routine use in the diagnosis of H. pylori.', 'Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection by invasive and noninvasive tests.. Although several invasive and noninvasive tests have been developed for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection, all of the tests have their limitations. We conducted a study to investigate and compare the suitability of rapid urease test (RUT), serology, histopathology and stool antigen tests with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of H. pylori, and correlate the diagnostic methods with PCR. Eighty nine patients ( adults, children) referred to the Firoozgar Hospital and Children Medical Center Hospital for diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy entered to the study and noninvasive tests such as immunoassay for serological antibodies against H. pylori and detection of its antigen in feces were measured. The biopsies were utilized for histological examination, RUT and PCR. The H. pylori statuses were evaluated by the positivity of ureC PCR in biopsy specimens and subjects had H. pylori positive result. Histopathology showed high overall performance in adults and children with sensitivity and specificity % and %, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for stool antigen test were %, % and %, respectively. Correlation of RUT, serology (IgG), histopathology and stool antigen tests with PCR were , , and , respectively. In conclusion, the RUT and histopathology are as accurate as the PCR of biopsy and stool antigen test can consider as appropriate noninvasive test for detection of H. pylori infection.']",test; tests; detection; pcr; diagnostic; sensitivity; specificity; noninvasive; culture; diagnosis,test · tests · detection

AIM: The role of endoscopic findings in deciding whether to biopsy the gastric mucosa of children remains unclear. The present study attempted, for the first time, to identify the value of endoscopic features for diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection in children. METHODS: Hp status of consecutive children receiving esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was established by combinations of histology, ()C-urea breath test, and serum Hp immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody. After routine EGD using a conventional endoscope, the presence of RAC (regular arrangement of collecting venules) was scored by close observation, which was carried out at two sites of lower corpus lesser curvature and upper corpus greater curvature. RAC-positive was defined as the presence of minute red points in a regular pattern. Antral nodularity was also scored as present/absent. RESULTS: Eighty-seven consecutive children ( boys, median age years, range - years) were evaluated; (%) were Hp positive. Antral nodularity was seen in (%) all of whom were Hp positive. The RAC-negative pattern based on examination of the upper and lower corpus yielded a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the presence of Hp infection of %, %, %, and %. Magnifying endoscopy confirmed that the RAC pattern corresponded to collecting venules in the gastric corpus.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is considered the most common etiology of chronic liver disease in Egypt, which may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous studies have documented an association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and liver cirrhosis with or without HCC. This study aimed to investigate the presence of H. pylori DNA in the liver tissue of Egyptian patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). METHODS: Fifty-two CHC Egyptian patients were enrolled in this study. Plasma anti-H. pylori IgG was assessed with ELISA. Liver biopsies were tested for presence of Helicobacter DNA using genus specific nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and species was identified by sequencing. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori IgG was detected in / (%) CHC patients while Helicobacter DNA was detected in (%) patients, all were H. Pylori by sequencing. Helicobacter DNA was more frequent in patients with high stage liver fibrosis (%) than in those with low stage fibrosis (%) (P = ). There was no association between the presence of H. pylori DNA in the liver and age, gender of patients, liver function tests, AFP levels or viral load. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the presence of H. pylori DNA in liver of some CHC Egyptian patients and suggest an association of this bacterium with progression of liver fibrosis.', 'Presence of Helicobacter spp. DNA in the gallbladder of Egyptian patients with gallstone diseases.. Earlier reports on the detection of Helicobacter DNA in the gallbladder tissue of patients with biliary diseases have shown discordant results. This study aimed to detect the presence of Helicobacter in gallstone, gallbladder tissue and bile specimens from subjects with H. pylori-positive gastritis with cholelithiasis. The presence of H. pylori in antrum biopsies was confirmed by rapid urease test and/or histopathological examination.

The presence of Helicobacter genus-specific DNA (16S rRNA genes) was determined by nested polymerase chain reaction assay. Helicobacter DNA was detected in the gallbladder tissue and bile of % and % respectively of the patients, but was not detected in any of the gallstones.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent studies have suggested that bacterial coinfection with Helicobacter species in patients already infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) could be involved in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A retrospective cross sectional study was performed in order to explore the association between Helicobacter species and HCV associated liver diseases. METHODS: The presence of Helicobacter species was tested by polymerase chain reaction on liver samples from four groups of patients. RESULTS: Helicobacter 16S rDNA was found in only % of liver samples from control patients (n=) and in % of liver samples from patients with non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis C (n=) while it was found in % of liver samples from patients with HCV positive cirrhosis without HCC (n=) as well as in % of cirrhotic liver samples from patients with HCV positive cirrhosis and HCC (n=). In addition, when the HCC tumour tissue was tested (n=), % of samples were positive. DNA from Helicobacter pylori- and Helicobacter pullorum-like organisms was found. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between the presence of Helicobacter species DNA in the liver and hepatitis C cirrhosis, with or without HCC. Indeed, the presence of these bacteria could be the result of structural changes in the liver. Alternatively, Helicobacter species could be a co-risk factor in HCV chronic liver diseases.

Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric carcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. Apoptosis induced by microbial infections is implicated in the pathogenesis of H. pylori infection. Enhanced gastric epithelial cell apoptosis during H. pylori infection was suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic gastritis and gastric pathology. In addition to directly triggering apoptosis, H. pylori induces sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells. Human gastric epithelial cells sensitized to H. pylori confer susceptibility to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via modulation of death-receptor signaling. The induction of TRAIL sensitivity by H. pylori is dependent upon the activation of caspase- and its downstream pathway. H. pylori induces caspase- activation via enhanced assembly of the TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex through downregulation of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein. Moreover, H. pylori infection induces infiltration of T lymphocytes and triggers inflammation to augment apoptosis. In H. pylori infection, significant increases in CCR6+ CD3+ T cell infiltration in the gastric mucosa was observed, and the CCR6 ligand, CCL20 chemokine, was selectively expressed in inflamed gastric tissues. These mechanisms initiate chemokine-mediated T lymphocyte trafficking into inflamed epithelium and induce mucosal injury during Helicobacter infection. This article will review recent findings on the interactions of H. pylori with host-epithelial signaling pathways and events involved in the initiation of gastric pathology, including gastric inflammation and mucosal damage.', 'Induction of COX-2 expression by Helicobacter pylori is mediated by activation of epidermal growth factor receptor in gastric epithelial cells.. Chronic infection of the gastric mucosa by Helicobacter pylori is associated with an increased risk of developing gastric cancer; however, the vast majority of infected individuals never develop this disease. One H. pylori virulence factor that increases gastric cancer risk is the cag pathogenicity island, which encodes a bacterial type IV secretion system. Cyclooxygenase- (COX-) expression is induced by proinflammatory stimuli, leading to increased prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) secretion by gastric epithelial cells. COX- expression is increased in gastric tissue from H. pylori-infected persons. H. pylori also activates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in gastric epithelial cells. We now demonstrate that H. pylori-induced activation of COX- in gastric cells is dependent upon EGFR activation, and that a functional cag type IV secretion system and direct bacterial contact are necessary for full induction of COX- by gastric epithelial cells. PGE₂ secretion is increased in cells infected with H. pylori, and this induction is dependent on a functional EGFR. Increased apoptosis in response to H. pylori occurs in cells treated with a COX- inhibitor, as well as COX--/- cells, indicating that COX- expression promotes cell survival. In vivo, COX- induction by H. pylori is significantly reduced in mice deficient for EGFR activation compared with wild-type mice with a fully functional receptor. Collectively, these findings indicate that aberrant activation of the EGFR-COX- axis may lower the threshold for carcinogenesis associated with chronic H. pylori infection.', ""Epidermal growth factor receptor activation protects gastric epithelial cells from Helicobacter pylori-induced apoptosis.. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Helicobacter pylori infection disrupts the balance between gastric epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, which is likely to lower the threshold for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. H pylori infection is associated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) activation through metalloproteinase-dependent release of EGFR ligands in gastric epithelial cells. Because EGFR signaling regulates cell survival, we investigated whether activation of EGFR following H pylori infection promotes gastric epithelial survival. METHODS: Mouse conditionally immortalized stomach epithelial cells (ImSt) and a human gastric epithelial cell line, AGS cells, as well as wild-type and kinase-defective EGFR (EGFRwa2) mice, were infected with the H pylori cag+ strain . Apoptosis, caspase activity, EGFR activation (phosphorylation), and EGFR downstream targets were analyzed. RESULTS: Inhibiting EGFR kinase activity or decreasing EGFR expression significantly increased H pylori-induced apoptosis in ImSt. Blocking H pylori-induced EGFR activation with a heparin-binding (HB)-EGF neutralizing antibody or abrogating a disintegrin and matrix metalloproteinase- (ADAM-) expression increased apoptosis of H pylori-infected AGS and ImSt, respectively. Conversely, pretreatment of ImSt with HB-EGF completely blocked H pylori-induced apoptosis. H pylori infection stimulated gastric epithelial cell apoptosis in EGFRwa2 but not in wild-type mice. Furthermore, H pylori-induced EGFR phosphorylation stimulated phosphotidylinositol-'-kinase-dependent activation of the antiapoptotic factor Akt, increased expression of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-, and decreased expression of the proapoptotic factor Bax. CONCLUSIONS: EGFR activation by H pylori infection has an antiapoptotic effect in gastric epithelial cells that appears to involve Akt signaling and Bcl family members. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms of H pylori-associated tumorigenesis.""]",cells; epithelial; apoptosis; expression; cell; ags; activation; pyloriinduced; gastric; by,cells · epithelial · apoptosis

We aimed to test for associations between polymorphisms in IL1B (- and +), IL10- and IL1RN variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and risk of gastric cancer in a Mexican population. DNA was extracted from sera of gastric adenocarcinoma patients and controls. The IL1B-, IL1B+ and IL10- biallelic polymorphisms were discriminated using ' Nuclease (TaqMan) assays and Pyrosequencing. The IL1RN penta-allelic VNTR polymorphism was genotyped using PCR followed by GeneScan analysis.

Lessons from comparative genomics.. BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori, the human gastric pathogen, causes a variety of gastric diseases ranging from mild gastritis to gastric cancer. While the studies on H. pylori are dominated by those based on either East Asian or Western strains, information regarding H. pylori strains prevalent in the Middle East remains scarce. Therefore, we carried out whole-genome sequencing and comparative analysis of three H. pylori strains isolated from three native Arab, Kuwaiti patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H. pylori strains were sequenced using Illumina platform. The sequence reads were filtered and draft genomes were assembled and annotated. Various pathogenicity-associated regions and phages present within the genomes were identified. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out to determine the genetic relatedness of Kuwaiti strains to various lineages of H. pylori. The core genome content and virulence-related genes were analyzed to assess the pathogenic potential. RESULTS: The three genomes clustered along with HpEurope strains in the phylogenetic tree comprising various H. pylori lineages. A total of genes spread among various functional classes were identified in the core genome analysis. The three genomes possessed a complete cagPAI and also retained most of the known outer membrane proteins as well as virulence-related genes. The cagA gene in all three strains consisted of an AB-C type EPIYA motif. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative genomic analysis of Kuwaiti H. pylori strains revealed a European ancestry and a high pathogenic potential.', 'Molecular epidemiology, population genetics, and pathogenic role of Helicobacter pylori.. Helicobacter pylori infection is linked to various gastroduodenal diseases; however, only approximately % of infected individuals develop severe diseases. Despite the high prevalence of H. pylori infection in Africa and South Asia, the incidence of gastric cancer in these areas is much lower than in other countries. Furthermore, the incidence of gastric cancer tends to decrease from north to south in East Asia. Such geographic differences in the pathology can be explained, at least in part, by the presence of different types of H. pylori virulence factors, especially cagA, vacA, and the right end of the cag pathogenicity island. The genotype of the virulence genes is also useful as a tool to track human migration utilizing the high genetic diversity and frequent recombination between different H. pylori strains. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis using seven housekeeping genes can also help to predict the history of human migrations. Population structure analysis based on MLST has revealed seven modern population types of H. pylori, which derived from six ancestral populations. Interestingly, the incidence of gastric cancer is closely related to the distribution of H. pylori populations. The different incidence of gastric cancer can be partly attributed to the different genotypes of H. pylori circulating in different geographic areas. Although approaches by MLST and virulence factors are effective, these methods focus on a small number of genes and may miss information conveyed by the rest of the genome. Genome-wide analyses using DNA microarray or whole-genome sequencing technology give a broad view on the genome of H. pylori. In particular, next-generation sequencers, which can read DNA sequences in less time and at lower costs than Sanger sequencing, enabled us to efficiently investigate not only the evolution of H. pylori, but also novel virulence factors and genomic changes related to drug resistance.', 'Strain-specific genes of Helicobacter pylori: genome evolution driven by a novel type IV secretion system and genomic island transfer.. The availability of multiple bacterial genome sequences has revealed a surprising extent of variability among strains of the same species. The human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is known as one of the most genetically diverse species. We have compared the genome sequence of the duodenal ulcer strain P12 and six other H. pylori genomes to elucidate the genetic repertoire and genome evolution mechanisms of this species. In agreement with previous findings, we estimate that the core genome comprises about genes and that H. pylori possesses an open pan-genome. Strain-specific genes are preferentially located at potential genome rearrangement sites or in distinct plasticity zones, suggesting two different mechanisms of genome evolution. The P12 genome contains three plasticity zones, two of which encode type IV secretion systems and have typical features of genomic islands. We demonstrate for the first time that one of these islands is capable of self-excision and horizontal transfer by a conjugative process. We also show that excision is mediated by a protein of the XerD family of tyrosine recombinases. Thus, in addition to its natural transformation competence, conjugative transfer of genomic islands has to be considered as an important source of genetic diversity in H. pylori.']",genome; genes; strains; genomes; sequences; genetic; genomic; diversity; sequence; isolates,genome · genes · strains

The urea breath test is a noninvasive and very accurate test for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection. However, false negative urea breath test results have been reported to occur in a considerable percentage of the individuals taking proton pump inhibitors; the interval needed to be completely confident that false negative tests had been excluded has varied among the different studies between and days. The impact of H()-receptor antagonists on the accuracy of urea breath test remains controversial, although, in contrast with proton pump inhibitors, the data suggest that H()-receptor antagonists, for the most part, have little effect on the result of the urea breath test. The urea breath test does not represent a suitable tool for estimating the density of H. pylori colonization. The only quantitative information to be obtained from the urea breath test is that the higher the delta value, the lower the probability of a false-positive urea breath test result. Although some authors have demonstrated a correlation between urea breath test values and histological lesions of the gastric mucosa, the practical utility of this relationship remains unclear. It has been suggested that the pretreatment urea breath test has the potential to identify patients who require modification of the standard therapeutic regimen (for example, prolonging the duration of treatment or increasing the pharmacological dose when bacterial density is high), but other studies could not confirm this relationship.

In studies that compared the ¹³C UBT with serology, the 1¹³C UBT sensitivity was % (% CI, -) and specificity was % (% CI, -). The sensitivity and specificity for serology were % (% CI, -) and % (% CI, -), respectively. In RCT, symptom resolution, medication use, and physician visits were similar among the ¹³C UBT, serology, gastroscopy, or empirical treatment arms. However, patients tested with ¹³C UBT reported higher dyspepsia-specific quality of life scores. LIMITATIONS: Processing of the ¹³C UBT results can vary according to many factors. Further, the studies showed significant heterogeneity and used different composite reference standards. CONCLUSIONS: The ¹³C UBT is an accurate test with high sensitivity and specificity. Compared with serology, it has higher specificity. There is a paucity of data on the ¹³C UBT beyond test accuracy. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Breath test for detecting bacteria in patients with ulcer-like symptoms. Dyspepsia is a condition that causes long-term pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen. Symptoms can include heartburn, burping, bloating, nausea, or slow digestion. Dyspepsia can be caused by a bacterium that also causes ulcers and stomach cancer. Half of the world's people are believed to be infected with these bacteria. A test has been developed to detect the bacteria in a breath sample. Our review determined the accuracy of this breath test in adults with ulcer-like symptoms. From studies, the breath test correctly identified % of patients with the bacteria and % of patients without the bacteria, as determined by a reference standard. Six studies compared the breath test to a blood test that is currently used. Both the breath and blood tests performed well in correctly identifying patients with the bacteria. However, the blood test was incorrectly positive in more patients who did not have the bacteria according to the breath test. This means that more patients would have received unnecessary treatment. Thus, the breath test is an accurate test to detect the bacteria in adult patients who have ulcer-like symptoms. But the many differences among the studies in our review included several steps taken to perform the breath test and the reference standards used to compare a blood test with the breath test."", '[Value of urease breath test in helicobacter pylori infection diagnostics among children and youth].. UNLABELLED: One of non-invasive methods of Helicobacter pylori diagnostics is the breath test with urea 13C. THE AIM: of the study was to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of urea breath test (UBT) in Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection diagnosis among children and youth. PATIENTS AND METHODS: medical records of patients, hospitalised due to gastrointestinal disorders, between and years of age were analysed. In all patients urea breath test, endoscopy of upper gastrointestinal tract with macroscopic assessment of gastric and duodenal mucosa and morphologic assessment of biopsy specimens were performed. RESULTS: positive results of urea breath test were present in twenty-six patients. In five patients (%) breath test was positive despite the lack of Helicobacter pylori infection in histhopathology samples. This group was % of all patients who had positive result of breath test. Among (%) patients result of breath test was correlated with positive result of histhopathology studies. This group was % of all patients with positive results of breath test. Among the remaining patients (%) results of breath test were negative. The results of Hp and UBT correlation are as follows: in % children: Hp (-), UBT (-), in % Hp (-), UBT (+), in % children: Hp (+), UBT (-), in %, Hp (+), UBT (+) CONCLUSIONS: result of urea breath test should be verified by endoscopy studies with morphologic assessment of specimens to avoid overdiagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection.']",breath; ubt; test; urea; 13curea; 13cubt; tests; cubt; positive; dob,breath · ubt · test

H. pylori is a definite carcinogen of gastric cancer. Animal studies have revealed that primary prevention of gastric cancer by H. pylori eradication is more effective as the duration between H. pylori infection and H. pylori eradication is decreased. In human, the cohort studies showed H. pylori eradication reduced the incidence of gastric cancer in the case with high incidence rate of gastric cancer. In a multi-center, randomized controlled study, H. pylori eradication prevented the incidence of metachronous cancer after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer. Meta-analysis of RCT suggested that the incidence of gastric cancer was suppressed by H. pylori eradication. The strategy for elimination of gastric cancer in Japan should consist of H. pylori eradication as primary prevention and surveillance of gastric cancer using endoscopy as secondary prevention.', 'Effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication on incidence of gastric cancer in human and animal models: underlying biochemical and molecular events.. BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer remains one of the most common cancers worldwide. A strong association exists between Helicobacter pylori infection and the risk of developing noncardia gastric cancer. H. pylori eradication by antibiotic treatment is regarded as a primary chemoprevention strategy to reduce gastric cancer incidence. AIM: To analyze the efficacy of H. pylori eradication in preventing gastric cancer in human and animal models, and to discuss whether biochemical, genetic, and epigenetic changes associated with H. pylori infection are reversible after curing the infection. RESULTS: Several intervention trials have indicated that in some patients, H. pylori eradication leads to regression and prevents the progression of precancerous lesions. The eradication therapy reduces gastric cancer incidence in patients without any precancerous lesions at the baseline and is most effective before the development of atrophic gastritis. A few recent intervention studies in Japan have demonstrated significant prophylactic effects of eradication therapy on the development of gastric cancer, suggesting the use of eradication therapy in high-risk populations as a gastric cancer reduction strategy. However, gastric cancer may still develop despite successful eradication therapy. Studies in animal models have confirmed the use of eradication therapy at an early point of infection to prevent gastric cancer development. CONCLUSION: H. pylori eradication may not completely abolish the risk of gastric cancer. However, eradication therapy may be used in high-risk populations to reduce gastric cancer incidence. It can reverse many biochemical, genetic, and epigenetic changes that H. pylori infection induces in the stomach.', 'The effect of eradication of Helicobacter pylori on gastric cancer prevention in healthy asymptomatic populations.. BACKGROUND: Although many epidemiologic studies have evaluated the effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication on gastric cancer, the effect is still uncertain in general populations. We evaluated whether H. pylori eradication would affect the incidence of gastric cancer in healthy asymptomatic populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in asymptomatic individuals, who underwent health screening examinations more than twice between and . We investigated the incidence of gastric cancer among groups: those without H. pylori infection (Hp-negative group), those with H. pylori eradication (eradication group), and those without H. pylori eradication (non-eradication group). RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of gastric cancer was cases per person-years during a median of years. In a multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model, the cumulative incidence of gastric cancer in the non-eradication group was significantly higher than those in the Hp-negative (hazard ratio [HR] , P < .) and eradication groups (HR , P = .). However, the cumulative incidence of gastric cancer was not significantly different between the eradication and Hp-negative groups. Other risk factors for gastric cancer occurrence were age, smoking, family history of gastric cancer, and gastric atrophy. The standardized incidence ratios of the age groups above and below in the eradication group were all significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori eradication reduced the cumulative incidence of gastric cancer in healthy asymptomatic population, and the effect of H. pylori eradication on the prevention of gastric cancer was observed in all ages.']",cancer; eradication; gastric; after; incidence; risk; prevention; gc; years; early,cancer · eradication · gastric

BACKGROUND: Most studies of the relationship between duodenogastric reflux (DGR) and Helicobacter pylori have reported that the presence of DGR decreases H. pylori colonization, while H. pylori infection increases the frequency of DGR by impairing antroduodenal motility. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between primary DGR and the prevalence of H. pylori in children, as well as the degree of colonization and the presence and severity of gastritis. METHODS: Included in the study were patients between the ages of and years, referred to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic with complaints of dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and nausea/vomiting, who underwent upper gastrointestinal system endoscopic examination and stomach biopsy. The study group included patients with DGR, while non-DGR patients formed the control group. RESULTS: The mean age of patients with DGR was ± years, while the mean age of the control group was ± years (p = ). Of those with DGR, (%) were girls, while in the control group, (%) were girls (p = ). Of patients with DGR, were H. pylori (+) (%), while in the control group, were H. pylori (+) (%) (p = ). There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to H. pylori degree of colonization (p = ). Gastritis was present in (%) patients in the DGR group and (%) patients in the control group (p = ). A significant difference was found between the groups in terms of gastritis severity (p = ). CONCLUSIONS: The mean age of patients with DGR was significantly higher than that of patients without DGR, and DGR was found to be more common in girls. In patients with DGR, H. pylori prevalence was significantly lower than in those without DGR; however, no significant difference was found between the groups with respect to the colonization degree.', '[Pathogenic effects of primary duodenogastric reflux on gastric mucosa of children].. OBJECTIVE: Duodenogastric reflux (DGR) is a reverse flow of duodenal juice into stomach through pylorus composed of bile acid, pancreatic secretion, and intestinal secretion. The increased entero-gastric reflux results in mucosal injury that may relate not only to reflux gastritis but also esophagitis, gastric ulcers, carcinoma of stomach and esophagus. However, the exact mechanisms of gastric mucosal damage caused by DGR are still unknown. The objective of the present study is to investigate the pathogenic effect of primary DGR on gastric mucosa in children, and to explore the correlation of DGR with clinical symptoms, Hp infection and intragastric acidity. METHOD: Totally patients with upper gastrointestinal manifestations were enrolled and they were graded according to the symptom scores and underwent endoscopic, histological examinations and -hour intra-gastric bilirubin was monitored with Bilitec . Of the cases, underwent the -hour intra-gastric pH monitoring by ambulatory pH recorder simultaneously. The total fraction time of bile reflux was considered as a marker to evaluate the severity of DGR. The total fraction time of bile reflux was compared between the patients with positive and negative results under endoscopy and histologically, respectively. The correlations of the total fraction time of bile reflux with clinical symptom score, Hp infection, intragastric acidity were analyzed respectively. RESULT: The total fraction time of bile reflux in the patients with hyperemia and yellow stain gastric antral mucosa under endoscopy was significantly higher than that without those changes [% (% approximately %) vs. % ( approximately %), Z = -, P < ; % (% approximately %) vs. % ( approximately %), Z = -, P < respectively]. Histologically, the cases with intestinal metaplasia had significantly higher total fraction time of bile reflux than in the cases without intestinal metaplasia [% (% approximately %) vs. % ( approximately %), Z = -, P < ], but no significant difference was found either between the cases with and without chronic inflammation (P > ) or between the cases with and without active inflammation (P > ). The severity of bile reflux was positively correlated with the score of abdominal distention (r = , P < ), but no correlation with either the severity of intragastric acid (r = -, P > ), or Hp infection (r = , P > ) was found. CONCLUSION: Primary DGR could cause gastric mucosal lesions manifested mainly as hyperemia and bile-stained gastric antral mucosa under endoscopy and the gastric antral intestinal metaplasia histologically in children. There was no significant correlation between DGR and gastric mucosal inflammatory infiltration. DGR had no relevance to Hp infection and intragastric acidity. We conclude that DGR is probably an independent etiological factor and might play a synergistic role in the pathogenesis of gastric mucosal lesions along with gastric acid and Hp infection.', 'Prevalence of Histological Gastritis in a Community Population and Association with Epigastric Pain.. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gastritis is a common histological diagnosis, although the prevalence is decreasing in developed populations, alongside decreasing prevalence of H. pylori infection. We sought to determine the prevalence of the etiology of gastritis in a Swedish population sample and to analyze any associations with symptoms, an area of clinical uncertainty. METHODS: Longitudinal population-based study based in Östhammar, Sweden. A randomly sampled adult population completed a validated gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire (Abdominal Symptom Questionnaire, ASQ) in (N = ). Participants < years of age and who were eligible were invited to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) (N = ); accepted and underwent EGD with antral and body biopsies (average years, range - years; % male) with H. pylori serology. RESULTS: Gastritis was found in % (/; % CI -%). By rank, the most common histological subtype was reactive (/; %), then H. pylori (/; %), chronic non-H. pylori (/; %), and autoimmune (/; %). Gastritis was significantly associated with older age and H. pylori status (p < ). Gastritis subjects were divided into three histological categories: chronic inactive inflammation, autoimmune gastritis, and active inflammation; there was no difference in the presence of upper gastrointestinal symptoms when categories were compared to cases with no pathological changes. Functional dyspepsia or gastroesophageal reflux were reported in % (/) of those with gastritis (any type or location) versus % (/) with no pathological changes (p = ). Epigastric pain was more common in chronic H. pylori negative gastritis in the gastric body (OR = , % CI -). CONCLUSION: Gastritis is common in the population with a prevalence of % and is usually asymptomatic. Chronic body gastritis may be associated with epigastric pain, but independent validation is required to confirm these findings.

OBJECTIVES: Western guidelines recommend Helicobacter pylori eradication in H. pylori-associated gastric polyps, but Korean medical insurance does not approve its eradication. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of H. pylori eradication on gastric polyps. METHODS: Participants in a large screening cohort underwent baseline and follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy and H. pylori testing. The association between gastric polyps and H. pylori was estimated using odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for confounding factors and % confidence intervals (CIs). The effect of H. pylori eradication on the fate of polyps was also evaluated. RESULTS: The screening cohort included participants ( gastric polyps: hyperplastic polyps, fundic gland polyps, and adenomas). H. pylori infection showed a positive association with hyperplastic polyps (OR ; % CI -), but was inversely related to fundic gland polyps (OR ; % CI -). Removed polyps by biopsy or endoscopic resection or tiny polyps less than mm at baseline and positive conversion of H. pylori at follow-up were excluded.

METHODS: The clinical data of patients diagnosed with gastric polyps under endoscopy were selected for retrospective analysis, and the clinical data, gastroscopy, polyp histopathology, HP infection, and PPI usage of all subjects were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the patients with gastric polyps, there were significantly more women ( cases) than men ( cases), with a ratio of :. PPIs were used in % of cases for more than years. The pathological types of patients with gastric polyps in this study were fundic gland polyps, hyperplastic polyps, inflammatory fibrous polyps, and adenomatous polyps.

The positive rate of HP infection in patients with fundic gland polyps was significantly lower than that in patients with other types of polyps (P<). In patients with long-term use of PPIs, the incidence of fundic gland polyps increased significantly (P<). CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences among the different types of gastric polyps in terms of polyp position, shape, and size. The positive rate of HP infection in patients with fundic gland polyps was low. Long-term use of PPIs (> years) increased the incidence of fundic gland polyps to some extent.

This article summarizes the main conclusions drawn from the studies presented in Digestive Disease Week in on Helicobacter pylori infection. In developed countries, the prevalence of this infection has decreased, although it continues to be high. The prevalence in Spain is high (%) and does not seem to be decreasing. There is an increase in antibiotic resistance, which is correlated with the frequency of prior antibiotic prescription. H. pylori eradication improves the symptoms of ""epigastric pain syndrome"" in functional dyspepsia. The frequency of idiopathic peptic ulcers seems to be increasing. To prevent the development of gastric cancer, eradication therapy should be administered early (before intestinal metaplasia develops). H. pylori eradication in patients undergoing early endoscopic resection of gastric cancer reduces the incidence of metachronous tumors, although endoscopic follow-up should be performed periodically. H. pylori eradication induces MALT lymphoma regression in most patients and tumoral recurrence in the long term is exceptional; radiotherapy is an excellent second-line option; a watch and wait approach to histologic recurrence after initial MALT lymphoma remission is a reasonable alternative. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is an indication for eradication therapy in children as well as adults. There are several diagnostic innovations, such as high-resolution endoscopy, narrow-band imaging, a method based on the electrochemical properties of H. pylori, and the cytosponge. Quadruple therapy with bismuth is at least as effective as standard triple therapy. The superiority of ""sequential"" therapy over standard triple therapy should be confirmed in distinct settings. The efficacy of ""concomitant"" therapy is similar -or even better- than that of ""sequential"" therapy, but has the advantage of being simpler. A hybrid sequential-concomitant therapy is highly effective. In patients allergic to beta-lactams, the efficacy of treatment with a proton pump inhibitor-clarithromycin-metronidazole is insufficient. When standard triple therapy fails, the second-line option of a -day course of levofloxacin is effective and is simpler and better tolerated than quadruple therapy. Triple therapy with levofloxacin is also a promising alternative after failure of ""sequential"" and ""concomitant"" therapy. New-generation quinolones, such as moxifloxacin and sitafloxacin, could be useful as eradication therapy, especially as rescue therapy. When two eradication therapies have failed, empirical administration of a third (e.g. levofloxacin) is a valid option. Even after three eradication therapies have failed, an empirical rescue therapy (with rifabutin) can be effective. H. pylori reinfection is highly frequent in developing countries, probably due to intrafamilial transmission.', '[Helicobacter pylori-related diseases: dyspepsia, ulcer and gastric cancer].. The main conclusions drawn from the presentations related to Helicobacter pylori at Digestive Diseases Week are summarized. Several strains of H. pylori frequently infect the same patient, and consequently samples for culture should be obtained from the gastric antrum and body. The test-and-treat strategy in dyspepsia is as effective as empirical antisecretory therapy and is probably cheaper. The benefit of eradication therapy in patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia, although small, seems to be lasting. Eradication in the general population seems to reduce the development of dyspeptic symptoms in the long term and consequently could be cost-effective. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in peptic ulcer is decreasing and the frequency of idiopathic ulcers is increasing. Patients with H. pylori-negative bleeding ulcers have a high probability of hemorrhagic recurrence and should therefore receive maintenance antisecretory therapy. H. pylori eradication reduces the incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma, which could warrant a screening and treatment strategy for this infection in the general population in high risk areas. H. pylori infection should be eradicated in patients undergoing endoscopic mucosal resection for early gastric cancer. To prevent the development of gastric cancer, eradication therapy should be administered early, before gastric atrophy develops. H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive gastric lymphomas have an equally favorable prognosis. New diagnostic techniques have been developed: the ultra-rapid urease test, a simpler 14C-urea breath test, and an ELISA method for rapid bacterial susceptibility determination. In patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, the 13C-urea breath test performed immediately after emergency gastroscopy allows early diagnosis of infection. Eradication regimens with double doses of proton pump inhibitors are more effective than those with standard doses. ""Sequential"" therapy is more effective and cheaper than classical triple-drug therapy, although the superiority of administering therapy sequentially rather than concomitantly has not been established. In penicillin-allergic patients, a combination with levofloxacin and clarithromycin is a promising alternative in rescue therapy. Second-line rescue therapy with levofloxacin is effective and is also simpler and better tolerated than quadruple-drug therapy. The rate of quinolone resistance is increasing as a result of the widespread use of these antibiotics. Third-line treatment with levofloxacin is also a promising alternative. Even after the failure of three previous treatments, a fourth empirical rescue therapy (with levofloxacin or rifabutin) can be effective in more than half of patients. The annual recurrence rate of H. pylori infection is approximately % in developed countries and is higher than % in developing countries.', '[Helicobacter pylori-related diseases].. This article summarizes the main conclusions drawn from the presentations on Helicobacter pylori at Digestive Disease Week . Knowledge of this infection among the general population continues to be extremely limited. H. pylori is the main cause of ""aging"" of the human stomach. In developed countries, the prevalence of H. pylori infection has decreased but continues to be considerable. In most countries, clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance rates are markedly high. H. pylori eradication improves the symptoms of functional dyspepsia, but only in a minority of patients. The frequency of idiopathic peptic ulcers seems to be rising and their prognosis is worse. Most patients with gastric cancer have, or have had, prior H. pylori infection. The risk of developing preneoplastic lesions depends on the type (strain) of the microorganism. To prevent the development of gastric cancer, eradication therapy should be administered early (before the development of intestinal metaplasia). Among H. pylori-infected patients, those who receive long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors more frequently develop preneoplastic lesions. In patients who undergo endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, H. pylori eradication reduces the incidence of metachronous tumors. Eradication therapy induces regression of MALT lymphoma in most patients and tumoral recurrence in the long term is exceptional; eradication is a reasonable option even when H. pylori infection has not been identified in patients with MALT lymphoma. Several diagnostic innovations were presented, such as some polymerase chain reaction techniques for use in gastric biopsy specimens or gastric juice. The efficacy of triple standard therapy is clearly inadequate. The superiority of ""sequential"" therapy over standard triple therapy has not been definitively established. ""Concomitant"" therapy is more effective and is simpler than ""sequential"" therapy. After failure of standard triple therapy, second-line levofloxacin-based schemes for days are effective and are also simpler and better tolerated than bismuth-based quadruple therapy. Levofloxacin-based triple therapy is also a promising alternative after failure of ""sequential"" and ""concomitant"" therapies. New-generation quinolones, such as moxifloxacin, could be useful as eradication therapy, especially as rescue therapy. After failure of clarithromycin-based triple therapy, followed by that of levofloxacin-based triple therapy, a bismuth-based quadruple scheme is an acceptable alternative. Even after the failure of eradication therapies, a fourth empirical rescue therapy (with rifabutin) can be effective.']",research; pylori; is; diseases; helicobacter; disease; infection; the; of; and,research · pylori · diseases

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is one of the common gastrointestinal diseases, and its medical management has been developed so much that the incidence of its serious complications, such as bleeding and perforation, are declining significantly. Its prevalence in Korea is not definitely decreased, probably due to increasing proportion of elderly patients and their rising usage of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin. This study was conducted to identify the risk factors for development and recurrence of peptic ulcer disease in Korea. METHODS: From to , upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and detailed personal questionnaires were performed for patients who visited Department of Gastroenterology at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. In total, PUD patients and non-ulcer dyspepsia patients were included. The results of questionnaires and repeated upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at initial diagnosis time and follow-up periods were analyzed. RESULTS: Multivariable analysis showed that male, H. pylori infection, NSAIDs use and smoking were risk factors for the development of PUD. The use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 receptor antagonists has significantly reduced the risk of PUD in patients who had taken NSAIDs and/or aspirin. H. pylori infection was found as the only risk factor for the recurrence of PUD. CONCLUSIONS: For the old patients who are taking drugs, such as NSAIDs and aspirin, concomitant use of PPIs or H2 receptor antagonists should be considered to protect from the development of PUD.

Published literature from PubMed, EMBASE and CNKI (China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database) were retrieved. Twelve case-control studies with cases of GC and controls were included. Overall, IL- - A/T polymorphism was not associated with the risk of GC. However, when stratified for ethnicity/country, the results showed that A allele carriers had an increased risk of GC while T allele carriers had a decreased risk of GC in Korean people.

Although no correlation was found in the analysis of the IL-1B and IL-1RN polymorphisms, IL- - A/A genotype held a higher risk of atrophic gastritis [odds ratio (OR), ; % confidence interval (CI), -] and gastric cancer (OR, ; % CI, -) compared with the T/T genotype. We also found that the A/A genotype increased the risk of upper-third location (OR, ; % CI, -), diffuse (OR, ; % CI, -), poorly differentiated (OR, ; % CI, -), lymph node (OR, ; % CI, -), and liver metastasis (OR, ; % CI, -), and p53-mutated (OR, ; % CI, -) subtypes of gastric cancer. The A/A and A/T genotypes were significantly associated with higher levels of IL- protein compared with the T/T genotype. Neutrophil infiltration score was significantly higher in the A/A genotype than in the T/T genotype. In conclusion, we showed that the IL- - T > A polymorphism is associated with higher expression of IL- protein, more severe neutrophil infiltration, and increased risk of atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer.', '[Correlation of interleukin-10-1082G/a single nucleotide polymorphism to the risk of gastric cancer in north China: a case-control study].. BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The individual genetic susceptibility is important in the development of gastric cancer. The 1082G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of interleukin- (IL-), an immune suppressor gene, became a research hot spot in this field. This study was to analyze the distribution of IL--1082G/A SNP in a population from northern China, and explore its correlation to the susceptibility to gastric cancer. METHODS: Blood samples were taken from subjects in a high risk area of gastric cancer and in a low risk area. The genotype of IL--1082G/A was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Serum level of anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) IgG was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Matched by sex and age, specimens of normal gastric mucosa (NOR), specimens of superficial gastritis (GS), specimens of gastric erosion ulcer (GEU), specimens of atrophic gastritis (AG) and specimens of gastric cancer (GC) were selected to analyze the correlation of IL--1082G/A SNP to the susceptibility to gastric cancer. RESULTS: The detection rates of IL-- AA, AG, GG genotypes in the subjects were %, % and %, respectively. There were no differences in region and sex distribution of IL--1082AG+GG genotype between the high and low risk areas of gastric cancer. The detection rate of IL-- AG+GG genotype was significantly higher in gastric cancer than in benign lesions and normal mucosa (% vs. % and %, P=). As compared with the subjects with IL-- AA genotype and without H.pylori infection, the subjects with AG+GG genotype and without H.pylori infection [odds ratio (OR)=, % confidence interval (CI)=-], the subjects with AA genotype and H.pylori infection (OR=, % CI=-) and the subjects with AG+GG genotype and H. pylori infection [OR=, % CI=-] had higher susceptibility to gastric cancer, but there was no significant difference between every of the groups (P>). CONCLUSIONS: The susceptibility to gastric cancer is higher in the subjects with IL-- AG+GG genotype. There is no synergism between IL--1082G/A SNP and H.pylori infection.']",polymorphisms; polymorphism; genotype; risk; cancer; gc; ci; allele; gastric; or,polymorphisms · polymorphism · genotype · risk

AIM: To investigate screening makers for gastric cancer, we assessed the association between gastric cancer and serum pepsinogens (PGs). METHODS: The subjects comprised patients with gastric cancer, individuals with gastric atrophy, and healthy controls. Serum anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) immunoglobulin G (IgG), PGI and PG II were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gastric atrophy and gastric cancer were diagnosed by endoscopy and histopathological examinations. Odds ratios and %CIs were calculated using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Rates of H. pylori infection remained high in Northeastern China. Rates of H. pylori IgG positivity were greater in the gastric cancer and gastric atrophy groups compared to the control group (% and % vs %, P < ). Higher levels of PG II ( μg/L and μg/L vs μg/L, P < ) and lower PGI/PG II ratio ( and vs , P < ) were found in patients with gastric cancer or gastric atrophy compared to healthy controls, whereas no correlation was found between the plasma PGI concentration and risk of gastric cancer (P = ). In addition, multivariate logistic analysis indicated that H. pylori infection and atrophic gastritis were independent risk factors for gastric cancer. Lower plasma PGI/PG II ratio was associated with higher risks of atrophy and gastric cancer. Furthermore, plasma PG II level significantly correlated with H. pylori-infected gastric cancer. CONCLUSION: Serum PG II concentration and PGI/PG II ratio are potential biomarkers for H. pylori-infected gastric disease. PG II is independently associated with risk of gastric cancer.', 'Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis by serum pepsinogen levels.. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Gastric cancer develops due to atrophic gastritis induced by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Serum levels of pepsinogen (PG) are known to be excellent markers for evaluating the degree of atrophic gastritis. We investigated whether chronic gastritis could be diagnosed by evaluating serum PG levels. METHODS: A total of patients (average age, years; men) were included in this study. Fasting serum samples were collected and anti-H. pylori antibody and PG levels were evaluated. We evaluated the endoscopic atrophy grade or histological extent of gastritis, and calculated the diagnostic capability of this serum marker. RESULTS: A total of patients, were diagnosed as being positive () or negative () for H. pylori-induced gastritis. In patients with H. pylori-induced gastritis, the PG II levels were higher and the PG I/II ratios were lower than among those without H. pylori gastritis. A cut-off values of (i) PG I/II ≤ ; (ii) PG II ≥ or PG I/II ≤ ; (iii) PG II ≥ or PG I/II ≤ showed high sensitivity and accuracy (over %) for diagnosing H. pylori-induced gastritis. Moreover, in a mass screening of healthy subjects, a cut-off value of PG I/II ≤ might be better for diagnosing the presence of gastritis because of a sensitivity and specificity > %. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of H. pylori-induced gastritis can be evaluated using serum PG levels.', ""Using serum pepsinogens wisely in a clinical practice.. Serum pepsinogen (PG) has been used as biomarkers of gastric inflammation and mucosal status, including atrophic change, before the discovery of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Serum pepsinogen I (PG I) and pepsinogen II (PG II) levels are known to increase in the presence of H. pylori-related nonatrophic chronic gastritis. The measurement of serum PG provides much information on the presence of intestinal metaplasia as well as atrophic gastritis. The eradication of H. pylori provokes a significant change in serum PG values: it reduces both PG I and PG II and elevates the PG I to PG II ratio. Recently, the serum PG test method has been the first screening step in Japan, as well as photofluorography. Serum PG tests are used to screen for high risk subjects with atrophic gastritis, rather than as a test for cancer itself. Unlike photofluorography or endoscopy, serum PG screening can identify non-ulcerated differentiated asymptomatic cancer, irrespective of the size and location of the lesion. Most cases detected by the PG method are asymptomatic early gastric cancers and are limited to the mucosa, which are particularly well suited for endoscopic treatment. The PG method can contribute greatly to the patients' quality of life.""]",pg; pepsinogen; serum; levels; ratio; pgi; iii; ii; pgii; gastrin,pepsinogen · serum · levels

A number of Helicobacter species may confound experimental data because of their association with disease progressing in various kinds of laboratory animals. Screening of Helicobacter species is particularly desirable, because they are prevalent in commercial and research animal facilities. The aim of the present study was to compare three diagnostic methods [e.g. Helicobacter stool antigen kit (HpSA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid urease test (RUT)] for the identification of Helicobacter spp. in stools or gastric biopsy specimens collected from eight dogs suffering from gastritis. The gastroscopic biopsy specimens were tested using RUT and PCR, while stool specimens were evaluated using both HpSA and PCR. DNAs from the gastric biopsies and stool specimens were analyzed by both a consensus PCR that amplified the RNA polymerase beta-subunit-coding gene (rpoB) of Helicobacter spp. and a species-specific PCR to amplify the urease B gene of Helicobacter heilmannii, Helicobacter pylori, and Helicobacter felis. Helicobacter spp. were detected in % of the dogs, while H. heilmannii and H. felis were identified in and % of the dogs, respectively. The HpSA did not efficiently detect Helicobacter spp. in the stool samples compared to the RUT and PCR assays, both of which successfully detected Helicobacter spp. in the two sample types.

BACKGROUND: Non-Helicobacter pylori Helicobacters (NHPH) are also able to cause disease in humans. Dogs are a natural reservoir for many of these species. Close and intense human contact with animals has been identified as a risk factor and therefore, an important zoonotic significance has been attributed to NHPH. METHODS: To determine the prevalence of Helicobacter species and the gastric histopathological changes associated, gastric mucosa samples of dogs were evaluated. RESULTS: Only one dog presented a normal histopathological mucosa with absence of spiral-shaped organisms. A normal gastric mucosa and the presence of spiral-shaped bacteria was observed in two dogs. All remaining animals presented histopathological changes representative of gastritis. Helicobacter species were detected in dogs (%) by at least one detection method. Histological, histochemical and immunohistochemical evaluations revealed that Helicobacter spp. were present in (%), (%) and (%) dogs, respectively. Spiral-shaped bacteria were detected by qPCR analysis in (%) dogs. H. heilmannii-like organisms were identified in animals (%) and predominantly in the antral gastric region. H. salomonis was the second most prevalent species (%) although it was mainly found in association with other Helicobacter spp. and in the body gastric region. H. bizzozeronii and H. felis were less frequently detected. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that, despite the high incidence and worldwide distribution of gastric NHPH in dogs, the presence of specific Helicobacter species may vary between geographic regions. NHPH infections were significantly accompanied by mild to moderate intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration and mild to moderate gastric epithelial injury, but a clear relationship between gastritis and Helicobacter infection could not be established.', 'Gastric Helicobacter species associated with dogs, cats and pigs: significance for public and animal health.. This article focuses on the pathogenic significance of Helicobacter species naturally colonizing the stomach of dogs, cats and pigs. These gastric ""non-Helicobacter (H.) pylori Helicobacter species"" (NHPH) are less well-known than the human adapted H. pylori. Helicobacter suis has been associated with gastritis and decreased daily weight gain in pigs. Several studies also attribute a role to this pathogen in the development of hyperkeratosis and ulceration of the non-glandular stratified squamous epithelium of the pars oesophagea of the porcine stomach. The stomach of dogs and cats can be colonized by several Helicobacter species but their pathogenic significance for these animals is probably low. Helicobacter suis as well as several canine and feline gastric Helicobacter species may also infect humans, resulting in gastritis, peptic and duodenal ulcers, and low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. These agents may be transmitted to humans most likely through direct or indirect contact with dogs, cats and pigs. Additional possible transmission routes include consumption of water and, for H. suis, also consumption of contaminated pork. It has been described that standard H. pylori eradication therapy is usually also effective to eradicate the NHPH in human patients, although acquired antimicrobial resistance may occasionally occur and porcine H. suis strains are intrinsically less susceptible to aminopenicillins than non-human primate H. suis strains and other gastric Helicobacter species. Virulence factors of H. suis and the canine and feline gastric Helicobacter species include urease activity, motility, chemotaxis, adhesins and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. These NHPH, however, lack orthologs of cytotoxin-associated gene pathogenicity island and vacuolating cytotoxin A, which are major virulence factors in H. pylori. It can be concluded that besides H. pylori, gastric Helicobacter species associated with dogs, cats and pigs are also clinically relevant in humans. Although recent research has provided better insights regarding pathogenic mechanisms and treatment strategies, a lot remains to be investigated, including true prevalence rates, exact modes of transmission and molecular pathways underlying disease development and progression.']",species; suis; spp; dogs; helicobacter; cats; humans; animals; heilmannii; pigs,species · suis · spp

This study was conducted to assess the features and risk factors of GERD in Vietnamese patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on out-patients ≥ years of age who were presented with upper gastrointestinal symptoms and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Reflux esophagitis was graded according to the Los Angeles classification. Endoscopically suspected Barrett\'s esophagus (BE) was recorded according to the Prague C and M criteria and biopsy was taken for histologic examination.

BACKGROUND: Low-dose aspirin (- mg/day) is widely used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, due to its action on cyclo-oxygenase (COX), aspirin is associated with upper gastrointestinal (GI) side effects including ulcers and bleeding. SCOPE: This was a comprehensive review of the literature available on the side effects associated with low-dose aspirin, together with the available treatment and prevention options, which was based on the authors' expertise in the field and a supplementary PubMed search limited to papers published in English during the last years, up to November . FINDINGS: Although the risk of upper GI side effects is smaller with low-dose aspirin compared with non-selective, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), it is nevertheless a substantial healthcare issue. Factors associated with an increased risk of upper GI complications during low-dose aspirin therapy include aspirin dose, history of ulcer or upper GI bleeding, age > years, concomitant use of NSAIDs (including COX--selective NSAIDs), and Helicobacter pylori infection. Co-administration of a gastroprotective agent such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be useful for alleviating the upper GI side effects associated with use of low-dose aspirin. Eradication of H. pylori also appears to reduce the risk of these side effects, especially in those at high risk. The use of other antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel does not seem to provide a safer alternative to low-dose aspirin in at-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy is associated with an increased risk of developing upper GI side effects. Administration of a PPI seems the most effective therapy for the prevention and/or relief of such side effects in at-risk patients. H. pylori eradication therapy further reduces the risk of upper GI bleeding in these patients."", 'How to advise aspirin use in patients who need NSAIDs.. NSAIDs are widely used all over the world. NSAID use is rising due to increasing availability without a prescription, use of aspirin for prevention of thrombotic disorders and the ageing population. Aspirin is used as an analgesic drug in many countries, but the main current indication is low-dose aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular events. However, NSAIDs and aspirin use account for approximately -% of all reported drug adverse events. Most of those are gastrointestinal including dyspepsia, hemorrhage, perforation and even death. The COX-- selective inhibitors (coxibs) have demonstrated equivalent efficacy to nonspecific NSAIDs in the management of arthritis and pain but have less gastrointestinal adverse events, although coxibs and probably all NSAIDs, significantly increase risk of serious thromboembolic events. Concomitant use of low-dose aspirin is present in more than % of all patients taking either NSAIDs or coxibs, thus increasing the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Furthermore, at present, it is not known whether aspirin decreases the cardiovascular risks of COX- inhibitors or NSAIDs. Appropriate strategies for gastrointestinal risk reduction with NSAIDs and aspirin must consider the overall health status of our patients including the presence of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risk factors. Use of the lowest possible dose of these drugs, gastroprotectants, especially proton pump inhibitors and Helicobacter pylori eradication will reduce the risk of gastrointestinal side effects in patients taking low-dose aspirin and NSAIDs or coxibs.', 'Strategies to reduce the GI risks of antiplatelet therapy.. Low-dose aspirin and other antiplatelet agents are widely used for the management of cardiovascular disease. Due to their action on cyclooxygenase, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with upper gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, including ulcers and bleeding. Although the risk with low-dose aspirin alone is less than that with NSAIDs, given its widespread use, aspirin-related toxicity has become a substantial health care issue. Factors associated with an increased risk of aspirin-related upper GI complications are still being elucidated but most importantly include a prior history of ulcer or GI bleeding, aspirin dose, and concomitant use with an NSAID, anticoagulant, or additional antiplatelet drug. Various strategies are available to minimize the risk of developing upper GI side effects in patients taking aspirin. Gastroprotective agents that seem effective are prostaglandin analogues and proton pump inhibitors. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori also seems to reduce the risk of ulcers.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is one of the most common human bacterial pathogens, and infection causes a wide array of gastric disorders, including simple gastritis, peptic ulcers and gastric malignancies. Gastrointestinal inflammation caused by H. pylori can influence the absorption of glucose and lipids, which are also abnormal in diabetes mellitus. Type diabetes mellitus (T2DM), formerly known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or adult-onset diabetes, is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by high levels of blood glucose resulting from insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. It is an emerging pandemic and is rapidly becoming a serious threat to public health. Emerging data now indicate a strong relationship between H. pylori infection and the incidence of T2DM. The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of diabetes are complex, involving insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, insulin secretion deficiency as a result of pancreas β-cell dysfunction, glucotoxicity, and lipotoxicity. H. pylori infection is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, and the growing awareness of its role in diabetes is important for the early detection of glucose dysregulation and prevention of T2DM in high-risk communities.

However, their efficacy in children is uncertain and there are few well-designed studies. Here, we evaluated the eradication rates of standard triple therapy, bismuth-based quadruple therapy and sequential therapy in children with H. pylori infection. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was conducted in children infected with H. pylori in West China Second Hospital.

No esophagitis was present before eradication in patients. H. pylori was and was not eradicated in and , respectively. Reflux esophagitis developed in of the eradication group and in three of the treatment failure group, with prevalence higher with successful eradication (P = ). Successful eradication and hiatus hernia were significant risk factors for reflux esophagitis development. Twenty-seven of patients with pre-existing reflux esophagitis had successful eradication and six treatment failure. The reflux esophagitis grade worsened in two (Los Angeles classification from A to B) and improved in patients after eradication. With treatment failure, reflux esophagitis worsened in none and improved in three patients. There showed no significant change in the grade of pre-existing reflux esophagitis after H. pylori eradication but the sample size was too small to evaluate the difference. In conclusion, the eradication of H. pylori increases the prevalence of reflux esophagitis, and hiatus hernia was a significant risk factor for the development of reflux esophagitis.', 'Risk of Reflux-Related Symptoms and Reflux Esophagitis after Helicobacter pylori Eradication Treatment in the Japanese Population.. BACKGROUNDS: A meta-analysis of reports primarily from Western countries showed no association between Helicobacter pylori eradication and reflux esophagitis development. The risk of reflux esophagitis may differ among different populations based on H. pylori virulence factors and acid secretion ability. We evaluated the prevalence rates of reflux esophagitis in H.-pylori-positive Japanese subjects and assessed risk factors for reflux esophagitis after eradication. METHODS: Among H.-pylori-positive subjects who underwent H. pylori eradication from August to December , we evaluated the prevalence of reflux esophagitis on endoscopy at months after eradication success and the severity of reflux-related symptoms by the F-scale questionnaire at months after treatment and months after eradication success. RESULTS: The prevalence of reflux esophagitis in H.-pylori-positive patients at entry was % (/). At months after eradication success, the prevalence was % (/) (p < ). In the F scale, the median total score before treatment was (range: -), which significantly decreased to (range: -) (p < ) at months after treatment and (range: -) (p < ) at months after eradication success. Following multivariate analysis, the pretreatment total F-scale score was a risk factor for the development of reflux esophagitis (odds ratio: , % confidence interval: -, p < ). CONCLUSIONS: In this H.-pylori-positive Japanese population, eradication therapy was associated with reflux esophagitis in around % of patients, particularly in those with severe reflux-related symptoms at baseline. Reflux-related symptoms may improve throughout the months after successful eradication therapy, irrespective of the development of reflux esophagitis.', 'Effect of Helicobacter pylori infection and its eradication on reflux esophagitis and reflux symptoms.. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the association between current Helicobacter pylori infection and reflux esophagitis and the effect of H. pylori eradication on reflux esophagitis in a healthy screening population. METHODS: A total of , subjects in a comprehensive screening cohort were enrolled, and , subjects had follow-up after a median of years. Effects of H. pylori infection on reflux esophagitis were estimated with odds ratios (ORs) and % confidence intervals (CIs) using multiple logistic regression analysis. We evaluated the change in prevalence of reflux esophagitis and reflux symptoms after H. pylori eradication vs. persistence. RESULTS: The prevalence of reflux esophagitis (as classified by the Los Angeles system) was % (/,). Whereas the prevalence of reflux esophagitis was % (/,) in subjects without H. pylori infection, it was % (/,) in subjects with infection (P<). H. pylori infection had a strong negative association with reflux esophagitis in multivariate analysis (OR ; % CI, -). Compared with the prevalence of reflux esophagitis in the persistent infection group, the prevalence of reflux esophagitis increased after successful H. pylori eradication (OR ; % CI, -; P<), which was comparable to that of the H. pylori-negative group (OR ; % CI, -; P<). However, reflux symptoms had no association with H. pylori infection or eradication. CONCLUSIONS: In a healthy screening population, H. pylori infection had a strong negative association with reflux esophagitis, but H. pylori eradication increased the prevalence of erosive esophagitis to the level of H. pylori-negative individuals. Long-term clinical significance of newly developed erosive esophagitis after H. pylori eradication should be evaluated prospectively.']",reflux; esophagitis; gerd; gastroesophageal; re; erosive; disease; patients; symptoms; esophageal,reflux · esophagitis · gerd

Nickel is a virulence determinant for the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Indeed, H. pylori possesses two nickel-enzymes that are essential for in vivo colonization, [NiFe] hydrogenase and urease, an abundant virulence factor that contains nickel ions per active complex. Because of these two enzymes, survival of H. pylori relies on an important supply of nickel, implying a tight control of its distribution and storage. In this review, we will present the pathways of activation of the nickel enzymes as well as original mechanisms found in H. pylori for the uptake, trafficking and distribution of nickel between the two enzymes. These include (i) an outer-membrane nickel uptake system, the FrpB4 TonB-dependent transporter, (ii) overlapping protein complexes and interaction networks involved in nickel trafficking and distribution between urease and hydrogenase and, (iii) Helicobacter specific nickel-binding proteins that are involved in nickel storage and can play the role of metallo-chaperones. Finally, we will discuss the implication of the nickel trafficking partners in virulence and propose them as novel therapeutic targets for treatments against H. pylori infection.', ""Nickel-binding and accessory proteins facilitating Ni-enzyme maturation in Helicobacter pylori.. Helicobacter pylori colonizes the human gastric mucosa and this can lead to chronic gastritis, peptic and duodenal ulcers, and even gastric cancers. The bacterium colonizes over one-half of the worlds population. Nickel plays a major role in the bacteriums colonization and persistence attributes as two nickel enzyme sinks obligately contain the metal. Urease accounts for up to % of the total cellular protein made and is required for initial colonization processes, and the hydrogen oxidizing hydrogenase provides the bacterium a high-energy substrate yielding low potential electrons for energy generation. A battery of accessory proteins are needed for maturation or activation of each of the apoenzymes. These include Ni-chaperones and GTPases, some of which are unique to each Ni-enzyme and others that are individually required for maturation of both the Ni-enzymes. H. pylori's need for some conventional hydrogenase maturation proteins playing roles in urease maturation may have to do with the poor nickel-sequestering ability of the UreE urease maturation protein compared to other systems. H. pylori also possesses a NixA nickel specific permease, a nickel dependent regulator (NikR), a recently identified nickel efflux system (CznABC), and a histidine-rich heat shock protein, HspA. Based on mutant analysis approaches all these proteins have roles in nickel homeostasis, in urease expression, and in host colonization. The His-rich putative nickel storage proteins Hpn and Hpn-like play roles in nickel detoxification and may influence the levels of Ni-activated urease that can be achieved."", 'Moving nickel along the hydrogenase-urease maturation pathway.. Hydrogenases and ureases play vital metabolic functions in all three domains of life. However, nickel ions are cytotoxic because they can inactivate enzymes that require less competitive ions (e.g. Mg2+) in the Irving-Williams series to function. Life has evolved elegant mechanisms to solve the problem of delivering the toxic metal to the active site of nickel-containing enzymes inside the cells. Here, we review our current understanding of nickel trafficking along the hydrogenase and urease maturation pathways. Metallochaperones and accessory proteins (SlyD, HypA, HypB, UreD, UreE, UreF, and UreG) form specific protein complexes to allow the transfer of nickel from one protein to another without releasing the toxic metal into the cytoplasm. The role of SlyD is not fully understood, but it can interact with and transfer its nickel to HypB. In the hydrogenase maturation pathway, nickel is transferred from HypB to HypA, which can then deliver its nickel to the hydrogenase large subunit precursor. In Helicobacter pylori, the urease maturation pathway receives its nickel from HypA of the hydrogenase maturation pathway via the formation of a HypA/UreE2 complex. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding promotes the formation of a UreE2G2 complex, where UreG receives a nickel from UreE. In the final step of the urease maturation, nickel/GTP-bound UreG forms an activation complex with UreF, UreD, and apo-urease. Upon GTP hydrolysis, nickel is released from UreG to the urease. Finally, some common themes learned from the hydrogenase-urease maturation pathway are discussed.']",nickel; urease; metal; binding; nikr; hpnikr; ions; ni; hypa; niii,nickel · urease · metal

OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori ( H.pylori ) infection is usually acquired in early childhood. Invasive techniques used for diagnosis of H.pylori infection require endoscopic examination which is expensive and inconvenient and may cause complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a new noninvasive diagnostic method, stool antigen test for H.pylori in untreated children with recurrent abdominal pain. METHODS: Eighty children ( female, male) who have undergone upper gastrointestinal endoscopy due to recurrent abdominal pain were included in the study. The H.pylori stool antigen test (HpSA) is based on a sandwich enzyme immunoassay with antigen detection. HpSA sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were determined with reference to the results of both histology and rapid urease test as a gold standard ( H. pylori status). RESULTS: While of the children (%) tested were positive for H.pylori according to the results of both histology and rapid urease test, children had negative H.pylori status. Among those children, were found to be positive by HpSA. Of patients with negative H.pylori status, were H.pylori -negative also in the stool test. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of HpSA were found to be %, %, %, and %, respectively.

AIM: Controversy exists concerning the relation between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and coronary artery disease (CAD). We aimed to examine the relationship between HP infection and severity of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with chronic CAD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of patients ( [%] men; mean age ± years) scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery were consecutively enrolled in the cross-sectional study. According to rapid urease test and/or gastric biopsy samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin and according to Giemsa, patients were classified as HP positive (n=; %) or HP negative (n=; %). Coronary angiograms were scored by quantitative assessment, using multiple angiographic scoring system: ) vessel score (number of coronary arteries stenosed ≥%), ) Gensini score (assigning a severity score to each coronary stenosis according to the degree of luminal narrowing and its topographic importance) and ) angiographic severity score (number of coronary artery segments stenosed ≥%).

BACKGROUND: The role of infection in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is still a matter of debate. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the effect of CagA-positive Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) strains infection on coronary atherosclerosis in patients with coronary heart disease and to elucidate how cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA)-positive H. pylori strains infections were involved in coronary heart disease by examining the levels of serum lipid, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and oxidized low-density protein (oxLDL). METHODS: Recruited for this study were patients with coronary heart disease. The severity of coronary heart disease was estimated by calculating the Gensini score. Serum oxLDL and hsCRP were examined in all subjects. Current H. pylori infection was determined in all participants by means of a modified (13C) urea breath test (> dpm classified as positive). IgG antibodies against CagA protein were analyzed by enzyme immunoassays. Antibody titers against CagA (≥ U/ml) were classified as positive. All subjects were divided into three groups, including an uninfected group (n=), an H. pylori +CagA- group (n=), and an H. pylori +CagA+ group (n=). RESULTS: Significant differences were found among the three groups in levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, serum hsCRP, oxLDL, and severity of coronary atherosclerosis (p<). The levels of total cholesterol, LDL, apolipoprotein B, serum hsCRP, oxLDL were significantly elevated and the severity of coronary atherosclerosis was significantly increased in H. pylori +CagA+ group (p<). CONCLUSIONS: More serious coronary atherosclerosis was observed in CHD patients with H. pylori +CagA+ infection. H. pylori +CagA+ infection might be involved in coronary atherosclerosis by modifying serum lipids, enhancing LDL oxidation, and activating the inflammatory responses.', 'Helicobacter pylori infection in coronary artery disease.. The role of inflammation in the pathogenesis and progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) has been increasingly discussed, but still remains unclear. Inflammatory changes in the vessel wall play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Systemic inflammatory reaction can be detected by showing increased plasma levels of different proinflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins. Infectious agents have been linked to coronary heart disease on epidemiological and pathogenetic grounds. The prevalent condition and the exact mechanism of initiation of atherosclerotic vascular disease remain unclear. Nevertheless, many similarities exist between the processes of inflammation and atherogenesis, and the evidence is growing for the role of an active inflammation in the atherosclerosis in the coronary circulation and elsewhere. Although the seroepidemiological and eradication studies have suggested a causal relationship between Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and coronary heart disease; the issue is still controversial. The detection of Hp specific DNA in atheromatous plaque material from coronary arteries, but more important, the reduction in restenosis of coronary vessels after Hp eradication could be interpreted as an evidence for the involvement of a Hp infection in the progression of CAD induced by a local inflammatory process.']",coronary; atherosclerosis; carotid; cardiovascular; artery; heart; stroke; chd; infarction; risk,coronary · atherosclerosis · carotid

INTRODUCTION: Helicobacter pylori colonization is present in half of the world\'s population and can lead to numerous gastrointestinal diseases if left untreated, including peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. Although concurrent triple therapy remains the recommended treatment regimen for H. pylori eradication, its success rate and efficacy have been declining. Recent studies have shown that the addition of probiotics can significantly increase eradication rates by up to %. This meta-analysis examines the impact of probiotic supplementation on the efficacy of standard triple therapy in eradicating H. pylori. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar (time of inception to ) to identify all published randomized control trials (RCTs) assessing the use of probiotics in addition to triple therapy for the treatment of H. pylori. Searches were conducted using the keywords ""probiotics"", ""triple therapy"", and ""Helicobacter pylori"". RCTs comparing the use of probiotics and standard triple therapy with standard triple therapy alone for any duration in patients of any age diagnosed with H. pylori infection were included. H. pylori eradication rates (detected using urea breath test or stool antigen) were analyzed as-per-protocol (APP) and intention-to-treat (ITT). RESULTS: A total of RCTs involving , patients APP and , patients ITT were analyzed. The addition of probiotics significantly increased eradication rates by % (relative risk [RR] =; % confidence interval [CI], -; P<) APP and % (RR =; % CI, -; P<) ITT. Probiotics were beneficial among children and adults, as well as Asians and non-Asians. No significant difference was observed in efficacy between the various types of probiotics. The risk of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain was also reduced. CONCLUSION: The addition of probiotics is associated with improved H. pylori eradication rates in both children and adults, as well as Asians and non-Asians. Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, and mixtures of probiotics appear beneficial in H. pylori eradication. Furthermore, the reduction in antibiotic-associated side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and epigastric pain improves medication tolerance and patient compliance. Given the consequences associated with chronic H. pylori infection, the addition of probiotics to the concurrent triple therapy regimen should be considered in all patients with H. pylori infection. However, further studies are required to identify the optimal probiotic species and dose.', ""Are probiotics useful for therapy of Helicobacter pylori diseases?. Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a known risk factor for gastric cancer. Eradication rate of H. pylori infection by the classic triple treatment of PPIs and antibiotics is low. Therefore, probiotics are a useful tool for improving the rate of eradication and reduction of side effects. Several studies in animal models showed that Lactobacillus spp. alone and in combination with other probiotic strains have inhibitory effects on growth and suppression of inflammatory responses in H. pylori infections. However, some studies showed significant effects of Pediococcus strains on suppression, survival, and eradication of H. pylori infections. Therefore, it is suggested that in the treatment of H. pylori infections along with the usual probiotic strains, different strains of Pediococcus could be used. Recent studies showed that Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus gasseri alone with PPIs in human have a high eradication effect on H. pylori infections and it is suggested as the probiotic treatment of patient's in future therapeutic protocols. In relation to the probiotic treatment process, it should not be recommended that probiotics could be used as a single treatment for H. pylori eradication. However, use of probiotics as a supplement will increase eradication and reduce side effects associated with treatment. It is widely believed that probiotics could improve the eradication of H. pylori and reduce side effects during standard treatment, but some probiotic bacterial species could be useful with drug therapy.

Considering the presence of cysteine and N-arylacetamide derivatives in potent urease inhibitors, here, we designed hybrid derivatives of these pharmacophores. Therefore, cysteine-N-arylacetamide derivatives 5a-l were synthesized through simple nucleophilic reactions with good yield. In vitro urease inhibitory activity assay of these compounds demonstrated that all newly synthesized compounds exhibited high inhibitory activity (IC50 values = - μM) when compared with standard drugs (thiourea: IC50 = ± μM and hydroxyurea: IC50 = ± μM). Representatively, compound 5e with IC50 = μM was times more potent than strong urease inhibitor thiourea. Enzyme kinetic study of this compound revealed that compound 5e is a competitive urease inhibitor. Moreover, a docking study of compound 5e was performed to explore crucial interactions at the urease active site.

Background and objective Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are related but distinct conditions. Iron deficiency refers to a state where the body has insufficient iron stores, which can lead to anemia if not addressed. Iron deficiency anemia, on the other hand, is a more severe condition where the lack of iron has resulted in decreased hemoglobin levels, impacting oxygen transport in the blood. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection can contribute to iron deficiency through mechanisms such as chronic gastrointestinal bleeding and impaired iron absorption, potentially progressing to iron deficiency anemia. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of iron deficiency, including its potential progression to iron deficiency anemia, among patients diagnosed with H. pylori infection. Methodology This cross-sectional study was conducted at Bolan Medical Complex Hospital, Quetta, and included patients diagnosed with H. pylori infection via endoscopic biopsy or urea breath test, from January to June . Participants were aged years and older, excluding those with chronic diseases affecting iron metabolism, current iron supplement users, and pregnant women. Data were collected through questionnaires and medical records, and blood samples were analyzed for serum ferritin and hemoglobin levels. Statistical analysis included chi-square tests and logistic regression was performed in SPSS (version ; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY); p-value < was significant. Results Out of patients, (%) were iron deficient. The prevalence was highest among those over years (n = , %) compared to the - age group (n = , %). Males had a slightly higher prevalence of iron deficiency (n = , %) compared to females (n = , %). Patients with H. pylori infection for more than three years exhibited a higher prevalence of iron deficiency (n = , %) compared to those with less than one year of infection (/, %). Dietary habits also played a role, with vegetarians showing a higher prevalence (n = , %) compared to non-vegetarians (n = , %). Hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in iron-deficient participants, averaging ± g/dL, and logistic regression indicated significant associations between iron deficiency and both age (OR = , p = ) and infection duration (OR = , p < ). Conclusions The study revealed a significant prevalence of iron deficiency among H. pylori-infected patients, particularly in older adults, males, those with longer infection duration, and vegetarians. The findings underscore the need for routine monitoring and targeted treatment of iron deficiency in this population.', 'Serum hepcidin levels in Helicobacter pylori-infected children with iron-deficiency anemia: a case-control study.. Recently, hepcidin, an antimicrobial-like peptide hormone, has evolved as the master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. Hepcidin integrates signals from diverse physiological inputs, forming a key connection between iron trafficking and response to infection. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether Helicobacter pylori infection modulates serum hepcidin level and response to oral iron therapy in children with iron-deficiency anemia. This was a case-control study including children with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA; H. pylori infected and H. pylori noninfected) and healthy children with comparable age and gender as the control group. Iron parameters including serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, total iron binding capacity, and transferrin saturation and serum hepcidin levels were assessed initially and after months of oral iron therapy for IDA. Compared to the control group, serum hepcidin was significantly lower in H. pylori-noninfected children with IDA (P < ) and significantly higher in H. pylori-infected children with IDA (P < ). Hepcidin increased significantly in noninfected children with IDA after months of oral iron therapy (P < ). On the other hand, H. pylori-infected children showed nonsignificant change in hepcidin level after oral iron therapy (P > ). Although hepcidin showed significant positive correlations with serum ferritin, hemoglobin (Hb), iron, and transferrin saturation in noninfected children with IDA (P < ), it showed significant negative correlations with serum ferritin, Hb, iron, and transferrin saturation in H. pylori-infected children with IDA (P < ). H. pylori infection upregulates serum hepcidin levels and was associated with diminished response to oral iron therapy in children with iron-deficiency anemia.', ""Anemia in children with and without Helicobacter pylori infection.. BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in children. Recently there has been evidence to suggest a relationship between Helicobacter pylori gastritis and iron deficiency anemia. Because both H. pylori infection and iron-deficiency anemia are common in children, we studied any correlation between H. pylori infection and iron-deficiency anemia in children. METHOD: In a case-control study at the Children's Medical Center Hospital, children with H. pylori infection and children without infection according to histology were evaluated. Iron-deficiency anemia was diagnosed when serum ferritin and hemoglobin levels were less than adjusted values for age and sex. RESULTS: There were boys and girls with a median age of years. The main symptom was abdominal pain in H. pylori-infected and non-infected patients. Frequency of H. pylori infection in anemic and non-anemic patients was nearly similar ( and %, respectively). Among patients with H. pylori, % had anemia and in patient without H. pylori infection, its frequency was % (p = ). Among patients with H. pylori, % had iron-deficiency anemia and in patients without H. pylori infection, its frequency was % (p = ). Among patients with H. pylori, the difference between the severity of gastritis in those with anemia and those without anemia was not statistically significant (p = ) and no correlation was found between degree of H. pylori colonization and anemia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the proposal that H. pylori infection is associated with iron-deficiency anemia in children. Further studies emphasizing the socioeconomic status of children, evaluation of strains of H. pylori, and posttreatment measurement of serum iron and serum ferritin are necessary to show the possible association.""]",iron; deficiency; anemia; ida; ferritin; children; serum; hemoglobin; id; hepcidin,iron · deficiency · anemia

Dysregulation of noncoding microRNA molecules has been associated with immune cell activation in the context of Helicobacter pylori induced gastric inflammation as well as carcinogenesis, but also with downregulation of mismatch repair genes, and may interfere with immune checkpoint proteins that lead to the overexpression of antigens on gastric tumor cells. Numerous miR-molecules have been described as important tools and markers in gastric inflammation and cancer development -including miR-, miR-, miR-, miR-, and miR-- all of which are downregulated in gastric tumors, and involved in cell cycle growth or tumor invasion. Among the many microRNAs involved in gastric inflammation, adenocarcinoma development and immune checkpoint regulation, miR- is notable in that its upregulation is considered a key marker of chronic gastric inflammation that predisposes a patient to gastric carcinogenesis. Among various other miRs, miR- is highly expressed in activated B and T cells and in monocytes/macrophages present in chronic gastric inflammation. Notably, miR- was shown to downregulate the expression of certain MMR genes, such as MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6. In tumor-infiltrating miR--deficient CD8+ T cells, antibodies against immune checkpoint proteins restored the expression of several derepressed miR- targets, suggesting that miR- may regulate overlapping pathways to promote antitumor immunity. It may thus be of high clinical impact that gastric pathologies mediated by miR- result from its overexpression. This suggests that it may be possible to therapeutically attenuate miR- levels for gastric cancer treatment and/or to prevent the progression of chronic gastric inflammation into cancer.', 'Upregulation of miR-222 in both Helicobacter pylori- infected and noninfected gastric cancer patients.. Despite of promising improvements in treatment of gastric cancer, the mortality rate of this malignancy remains high. Chronic infection by Helicobacter pylori, interfering with intracellular signalling pathways, is the main risk factor for gastric cancer. Some evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNA), the small noncoding RNA molecules, can play role as oncogenes or tumour suppressors in the cells. MiR- is one of the remarkable miRNAs undergoing upregulation in gastric cancer. However, the association between miR- upregulation and H. pylori infection in gastric cancer tissues remains unclear. The aim of this study was to analyse the expression level of miR- in gastric cancer tissues, evaluating the relationship between miR- expression level and H. pylori infection and also finding novel miR- targets based on in silico investigations. MiR- expression level in patients including H. pylori positive and H. pylori negative was relatively measured using RT-qPCR and compared with healthy samples. In silico enrichment analysis of miR- targets was performed by DAVID database to evaluate the possible role(s) of miR- in gastric tumourigenesis. We observed upregulated level of miR- in gastric cancer tissues compared with normal samples (P<). However, no significant difference between miR- expression in H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative cases was observed. Our in silico analyses showed the possible role of p53, p27, PTEN and Elongin B in gastric cancer tumourigenesis. MiR- functions as an onco-miRNA and its overexpression can be involved in pathogenesis of gastric cancer, independent of H. pylori infection.', 'Downregulation of miR‑7 and miR‑153 is involved in Helicobacter\xa0pylori CagA induced gastric carcinogenesis and progression.. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection plays a pivotal role in the development of gastric cancer (GC). However, the association between aberrant microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) expression and H. pylori‑induced GC remains poorly understood. The present study reported that repeated infection of H. pylori caused the oncogenicity of GES‑ cells in BALB/c Nude mice. miRNA sequencing revealed that both miR‑ and miR‑ were significantly decreased in the cytotoxin‑associated gene A (CagA) positive GC tissues and this was further confirmed in a chronic infection model of GES‑/HP cells. Further biological function experiments and in vivo experiments validated that miR‑ and miR‑ can promote apoptosis and autophagy, inhibit proliferation and inflammatory response in GES‑/HP cells. All the associations between miR‑/miR‑ and their potential targets were revealed via bioinformatics prediction and dual‑luciferase reporter assay. Particularly, downregulation of both miR‑ and miR‑ obtained an improved sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing H. pylori (CagA+)‑induced GC. The present study identified that the combination of miR‑ and miR‑ may be regarded as novel therapeutic targets in H. pylori CagA (+)‑associated GC.']",mir; mirnas; mirna; expression; micrornas; mir146a; gc; mir5p; mir3p; microrna,mir · mirnas · mirna · expression · micrornas

The methylome is defined as a map of DNA methylation patterns at single-base resolution. DNA methylation in bacteria was first discovered as a function of restriction-modification (R-M) systems. R-M systems in Helicobacter pylori, like those in other bacteria, are important host-specificity determinants that provide protection against foreign DNA. Moreover, the gene regulatory role of the methyltransferase (Mtase) unit of various Helicobacter pylori R-M systems is being increasingly recognized. Recent advances in the application of single-molecule real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing to analyse DNA methylation have revealed for the first time comprehensive pictures of the genome-wide distribution of methylation sites in various strains of H. pylori. The methylomic data published so far have not only confirmed the significant inter-strain diversity of H. pylori Mtases and their DNA methylation profiles, but also identified numerous novel Mtase target recognition sites. The precise knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of Mtase recognition sites and their distribution within the H. pylori genome will in turn enable researchers to more readily test hypotheses on how H. pylori Mtases function to orchestrate gene regulation and/or modulate virulence. Methylomic studies hold promise for providing a deeper understanding into the roles of H. pylori Mtase and R-M systems in the physiology, epigenetics and possibly also pathogenesis of this important human pathogen. Consequently, the knowledge gained will provide crucial insights into the potential application of H. pylori methylomes as novel biomarkers for the prediction of disease outcome and/or antibiotic susceptibility.', 'Methylome diversification through changes in DNA methyltransferase sequence specificity.. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation have large effects on gene expression and genome maintenance. Helicobacter pylori, a human gastric pathogen, has a large number of DNA methyltransferase genes, with different strains having unique repertoires. Previous genome comparisons suggested that these methyltransferases often change DNA sequence specificity through domain movement--the movement between and within genes of coding sequences of target recognition domains. Using single-molecule real-time sequencing technology, which detects N6-methyladenines and N4-methylcytosines with single-base resolution, we studied methylated DNA sites throughout the H. pylori genome for several closely related strains. Overall, the methylome was highly variable among closely related strains. Hypermethylated regions were found, for example, in rpoB gene for RNA polymerase. We identified DNA sequence motifs for methylation and then assigned each of them to a specific homology group of the target recognition domains in the specificity-determining genes for Type I and other restriction-modification systems. These results supported proposed mechanisms for sequence-specificity changes in DNA methyltransferases. Knocking out one of the Type I specificity genes led to transcriptome changes, which suggested its role in gene expression. These results are consistent with the concept of evolution driven by DNA methylation, in which changes in the methylome lead to changes in the transcriptome and potentially to changes in phenotype, providing targets for natural or artificial selection.', ""Abstracts from the 3rd International Genomic Medicine Conference (3rd IGMC 2015) : Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 30 November - 3 December 2015..

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a major risk factor for gastric cancer and eradication of H. pylori is recommended as an effective gastric cancer prevention strategy. The infected individuals show microbial dysbiosis of gastric microbiota. In recent years, agrowing number of studies have focused on gastric microbiota changes following H. pylori eradication. In the present study, we aim to evaluate the influence of successful H. pylori eradication on the short-term and long-term alterations of human gastric microbiota using a method of systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We did a systematic search based on three databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science) in November . Additional articles were also identified by reviewing references cited in the included papers. Human studies that reported changes in gastric microbiota following successful H. pylori eradication were enrolled. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021293796. RESULTS: In total, nine studies enrolling participants were included. Regarding quadruple therapy, alpha diversity indexes increased within month after eradication; significant differences in gastric microbial community structure between before and after eradication were also seen within month. The trends of the above-mentioned diversity changes persisted with a follow-up of months. The microbial composition altered significantly after eradication and the relative abundance of H. pylori-related taxa decreased. Accordingly, gastric commonly dominant commensals were enriched. Bioinformatic analyses of microbiota functions showed that bacteria reproduction-related pathways were down-regulated and pathways of gastric acid secretion, etc. were up-regulated. For triple therapy, similar trends of alpha diversity and beta diversity changes were observed in the short-term and long-term follow-up. Also, after eradication, H. pylori was not the gastric dominant bacteria and similar changes in gastric microbial composition were found. For gastric microbial interactions, a decrease in microbial interactions was seen after eradication. Additionally, regarding whether successful H. pylori eradication could restore gastric microbiota to uninfected status, the results remain controversial. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, successful H. pylori eradication could reverse the gastric microbiota dysbiosis and show beneficial effects on gastric microbiota. Our findings may provide new insight for exploring the role of H. pylori and the whole gastric microbiota in gastric carcinogenesis.', 'The eradication of Helicobacter pylori restores rather than disturbs the gastrointestinal microbiota in asymptomatic young adults.. BACKGROUND: The eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) has been suggested to reduce the risk of gastric cancer, but its impact on the gut microbiota has attracted public attention. This study aimed to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of bismuth quadruple therapy on both gastric and fecal microbiota. METHODS: Ten asymptomatic young adults with H pylori-related gastritis were treated with bismuth quadruple therapy for days, and age-matched adults without H pylori infection were enrolled as healthy controls. Both fecal and gastric mucosa samples were collected from H pylori-positive patients at weeks , , and , while fecal samples were collected from healthy controls. The gastric and gut microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: The structure of the gastric microbiota was significantly changed after the eradication of H pylori with increased alpha diversity over time. The relative abundance of H pylori sharply decreased from more than % to nearly % after treatment, while some beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, were increased. The microbial diversity of gut microbiota was higher in H pylori-infected patients than in healthy controls, which tended to decrease after eradication. The potentially beneficial gut bacteria Blautia and Lachnoclostridium were enriched at week compared to week , while the pathogenic Alistipes were depleted to a level close to that of the healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Bismuth quadruple therapy for H pylori eradication can restore the diversity of gastric microbiota with enrichment of beneficial bacteria. The composition of gut microbiota after H pylori eradication trends toward healthy status instead of becoming dysbiotic.', 'Helicobacter pylori infection associates with fecal microbiota composition and diversity.. Helicobacter (H.) pylori is the most important cause for peptic ulcer disease and a risk factor for gastric carcinoma. How colonization with H. pylori affects the intestinal microbiota composition in humans is unknown. We investigated the association of H. pylori infection with intestinal microbiota composition in the population-based cohort Study-of-Health-in-Pomerania (SHIP)-TREND. Anti-H. pylori serology and H. pylori stool antigen tests were used to determine the H. pylori infection status. The fecal microbiota composition of H. pylori positive subjects and matched negative control individuals was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. H. pylori infection was found to be significantly associated with fecal microbiota alterations and a general increase in fecal microbial diversity. In infected individuals, the H. pylori stool antigen load determined a larger portion of the microbial variation than age or sex. The highest H. pylori stool antigen loads were associated with a putatively harmful microbiota composition. This study demonstrates profound alterations in human fecal microbiota of H. pylori infected individuals. While the increased microbiota diversity associated with H. pylori infection as well as changes in abundance of specific genera could be considered to be beneficial, others may be associated with adverse health effects, reflecting the complex relationship between H. pylori and its human host.']",microbiota; gut; diversity; abundance; microbiome; microbial; composition; 16s; sequencing; bacteria,microbiota · gut · diversity

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer significantly contributes to cancer mortality globally. Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is a stage in the Correa cascade and a premalignant lesion of gastric cancer. The natural history of GIM formation and progression over time is not fully understood. Currently, there are no clear guidelines on GIM surveillance or management in the United States. AIM: To investigate factors associated with GIM development over time in African American-predominant study population. METHODS: This is a retrospective longitudinal study in a single tertiary hospital in Washington DC. We retrieved upper esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs) with gastric biopsies from the pathology department database from January to December . Patients included in the study had undergone two or more EGDs with gastric biopsy. Patients with no GIM at baseline were followed up until they developed GIM or until the last available EGD. Exclusion criteria consisted of patients age < , pregnancy, previous diagnosis of gastric cancer, and missing data including pathology results or endoscopy reports. The study population was divided into two groups based on GIM status. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard induced by patient demographics, EGD findings, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) status on the GIM status. RESULTS: Of patients who had at least EGD with gastric biopsy, patients were included in the study. patients developed GIM during the study follow-up period of d on average, compared to d in patients without GIM (P = ). The average age of GIM group was years compared to years in the non-GIM group (P < ). In the GIM group, adding one year to the age increases the risk for GIM formation by % (P < ). Over time, African Americans, Hispanic, and other ethnicities/races had an increased risk of GIM compared to Caucasians with a hazard ratio (HR) of (, ), (, ), and (, ) respectively. No gender difference was observed between the study populations. Gastritis was associated with an increased risk for GIM development with an HR of (, ). On the other hand, H. pylori infection did not increase the risk for GIM. CONCLUSION: An increase in age and non-Caucasian race/ethnicity are associated with an increased risk of GIM formation. The effect of H. pylori on GIM is limited in low prevalence areas.', ""Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia in Children: Natural History and Clinicopathological Correlation.. INTRODUCTION: Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is defined as the replacement of the normal gastric epithelium by intestinal-type epithelium. GIM is considered a preneoplastic lesion for gastric adenocarcinoma in adults and is found in % of Helicobacter pylori ( H pylori ) exposed adults. However, the significance of GIM in pediatric gastric biopsies is still unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of children with GIM on gastric biopsies at Boston Children's Hospital between January and July . Demographic, clinical, endoscopic, and histologic data were collected and compared to age and sex-matched cohort without GIM. Gastric biopsies were reviewed by the study pathologist. GIM was classified as complete/incomplete based on Paneth cell presence or absence and limited/extensive based on its distribution in the antrum or both antrum and corpus. RESULTS: Of patients with GIM, were male (%), mean age of detection was ± years (range, - years). The most common histologic was chronic gastritis (%). Complete GIM was present in % (/) and limited GIM was present in % (/). H pylori was positive in patients. Two patients had persistent GIM on repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (/). No dysplasia or carcinoma was identified. Proton-pump inhibitor use and chronic gastritis were more common in GIM patients compared to control ( P = ). CONCLUSION: Most children with GIM had low-risk histologic subtype (complete/limited) for gastric cancer; GIM was rarely associated with H pylori gastritis in our cohort.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is an important precursor lesion to gastric cancer (GC), the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. There exist few data regarding the prevalence of, risk factors for, and clinical practice patterns regarding GIM in the United States. Furthermore, there are currently no U.S. guidelines regarding screening/surveillance for GIM. METHODS: All consecutive upper endoscopic procedures from academic medical centers in Seattle between and were reviewed. Demographic, clinical, and endoscopic covariates were recorded at time of endoscopy. Procedures with gastric biopsy were matched to final the histologic diagnoses, including the presence of Helicobacter pylori. Cases of GIM and dysplasia were recorded and compared with non-GIM controls using univariate and multivariable regression. Surveillance patterns for cases of GIM were recorded. RESULTS: Data from , upper endoscopies, , gastric biopsies, cases of GIM, cases of dysplasia, and cases of GC were captured. The point prevalence of GIM was % in patients who underwent gastric biopsy. Non-white race (P < .), increasing age (P < .), and presence of H pylori (P < .) were associated with GIM. If GIM was present, increasing age (P < .) and male gender (P < .) were associated with progression, and the presence of H pylori (P < .) was inversely associated with progression to dysplasia/GC. Few cases of GIM/dysplasia/GC were identified during procedures for GIM screening/surveillance. Only % of patients with a diagnosis of GIM received a recommendation for surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of GIM among non-white and Hispanic Americans. Risk factors for development of GIM may be distinct from the risk factors for progression to GC.']",gim; metaplasia; intestinal; im; olga; risk; gastric; surveillance; olgim; cancer,gim · metaplasia · intestinal

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) chronically colonizes gastric/duodenal mucosa and induces gastroduodenal disease such as gastritis and peptic ulcer and induces vigorous innate and specific immune responses; however, the infection is not removed, a state of chronic active gastritis persists for life if untreated. The objective of this study was to determine the number of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in gastric mucosa of patients with gastritis and peptic ulcer and determined the relationship between main virulence factor of H. pylori and Tregs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of patients with gastritis, patients with peptic ulcer and healthy, H. pylori-negative subjects were enrolled in this study. Expression of CD4 and Foxp3 was determined by immunohistochemistry. Antrum biopsy was obtained for detection of H. pylori, bacterial virulence factors and histopathological assessments. TGF-β1, IL- and FOXP3 expressions were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: The numbers of CD4+ and Foxp3+ T cells as well as the expression of IL-, TGF-β1, FOXP3, INF-γ and IL-17A in infected patients were significantly higher than the ones in uninfected patients. Also, the number of CD4+ T cells was independent on the vacuolating cytotoxin A (vacA) and outer inflammatory protein A (oipA), but it was positively correlated with cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA). Instead, the number of Foxp3+ T cells was dependent on the vacA and oipA, but it was independent on cagA. The number of Foxp3+ T cells and the expression of IL-, TGF-β1 and FOXP3 in infected patients with gastritis were significantly higher than the ones in infected patients with peptic ulcer. Moreover, the number of CD4+ T cells and the expression of IL-17A and INF-γ was the lowest in the gastritis patients, however, increased progressively in the peptic ulcer patients. Additionally, the numbers of CD4+ and Foxp3+ T cells as well as the expression of IL-, TGF-β1, FOXP3 and INF-γ were positively correlated with the degree of H. pylori density and chronic inflammation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the number and localization of CD4(+) Foxp3(+) Treg cells in stomachs and spleens of H. pylori-infected mice. The expression levels of Foxp3 as well as anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines before and after H. pylori triple eradication therapy were examined. We found that the percentages of CD4(+) Foxp3(+) Treg cells out of the lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) and spleen lymphocytes in the infection group were higher than the PBS negative control group and the treatment group. H. pylori antigen stimulation was associated with an increased number of Treg cells in vitro. Furthermore, compared with the PBS and treatment groups, a higher mRNA expression level of Foxp3 in the gastric tissue was detected in the infection group. IL- and TGF-β1 contents were increased significantly in the culture supernatant of spleen lymphocyte stimulated with H. pylori antigen. A marked elevation in serum IFN-γ level was observed in H. pylori-infected mice. In addition, gastric tissues of the infection group contained more Foxp3(+) cells. These results indicate that the percentage of CD4(+) Foxp3(+) Treg cells are increased in H. pylori-infected mice, suggesting a role of Treg cells in H. pylori-induced pathologies, even at the early stages of chronic gastritis and gastric tumorigenesis.', 'Role of Treg and TH17 cells of the gastric mucosa in children with Helicobacter pylori gastritis.. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to examine the expression of FOXP3, interleukin (IL)-, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, IL-17A, and T helper (TH17) cells/FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells balance in the gastric mucosa of children with Helicobacter pylori infection, in relation to the gastric histopathology. METHODS: Antral mucosal biopsies were obtained from children with H pylori(+) gastritis and age- and sex-matched normal controls. Histopathology was assessed by the updated Sydney classification. Gene expression of FOXP3, IL-, and TGF-β1 was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemical staining for FOXP3+ Treg and TH17 cells was performed. RESULTS: The gene expression levels of FOXP3, TGF-β1, and IL- messenger RNA (mRNA) and the number of FOXP3+ Treg were significantly higher in the H pylori(+) gastritis group than in the control group (P < ). FOXP3 mRNA levels were correlated positively with TGF-β1 and IL- mRNA levels in the H pylori(+) gastritis group (P < ). Furthermore, FOXP3 mRNA levels were correlated positively with the bacterial density, infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, and mononuclear cells in the H pylori(+) gastritis group (P < ). The number of TH17 cells was significantly higher in the H pylori(+) gastritis group than in the control group (P < ). In addition, the number of TH17 cells was correlated negatively with the bacterial density and positively with the inflammatory scores of polymorphonuclear cells and mononuclear cells in the H pylori(+) gastritis group (P < ). A negative correlation between the TH17 cells/FOXP3+ Treg ratio and the bacterial density was demonstrated in the H pylori(+) gastritis group (P < ). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that a TH17/Treg balance toward a Treg-biased response favors the persistence of bacteria, causing chronic active gastritis.']",il; cells; cd4; th17; mice; expression; il17a; treg; cytokines; response,cells · cd4 · th17

Helicobacter pylori strains carrying the cagA gene are associated with severe disease outcomes, most notably gastric cancer. CagA protein is delivered into gastric epithelial cells by a type IV secretion system. The translocated CagA undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at the C-terminal EPIYA motifs by host cell kinases. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA acquires the ability to interact with and activate SHP2, thereby activating mitogenic signaling and inducing cell morphological transformation (hummingbird phenotype). CagA also interacts with PAR1b via the CM sequence, resulting in induction of junctional and polarity defects. Furthermore, CagA-PAR1b interaction stabilizes the CagA-SHP2 complex. Because transgenic mice systemically expressing CagA develop gastrointestinal and hematological malignancies, CagA is recognized as a bacterium-derived oncoprotein. Interestingly, the C-terminal region of CagA displays a large diversity among H. pylori strains, which influences the ability of CagA to bind to SHP2 and PAR1b. In the present study, we investigated the biological activity of v225d CagA, an Amerindian CagA of H. pylori isolated from a Venezuelan Piaroa Amerindian subject, because the variant CagA does not possess a canonical CM sequence. We found that v225d CagA interacts with SHP2 but not PAR1b. Furthermore, SHP2-binding activity of v225d CagA was much lower than that of CagA of H. pylori isolated from Western countries (Western CagA). v225d CagA also displayed a reduced ability to induce the hummingbird phenotype than that of Western CagA. Given that perturbation of PAR1b and SHP2 by CagA underlies the oncogenic potential of CagA, the v225d strain is considered to be less oncogenic than other well-studied cagA-positive H. pylori strains.', 'Helicobacter pylori CagA: a new paradigm for bacterial carcinogenesis.. Infection with CagA-positive Helicobacter pylori is associated with the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. The CagA gene product CagA is injected directly from the bacterium into the bacterium-attached gastric epithelial cells via the type-IV secretion system. Upon membrane localization and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases, CagA functions as a scaffolding adaptor and interacts with a number of host proteins that regulate cell growth, cell motility and cell polarity in both CagA phosphorylation-dependent and phosphorylation-independent manners. Of special interest is the interaction of CagA with the SHP- tyrosine phosphatase, gain-of-function mutations that of which have recently been found in a variety of human malignancies. The CagA-SHP- interaction is entirely dependent on CagA tyrosine phosphorylation and, through the complex formation, SHP- is catalytically activated and induces morphological transformation with elevated cell motility. Intriguingly, structural diversity of the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of CagA accounts for the differential activity of individual CagA to bind and activate SHP-. Deregulation of SHP- and other intracellular signaling molecules by H. pylori CagA may predispose cells to accumulate multiple genetic and epigenetic changes involved in gastric carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the differential potential of individual CagA to disturb cellular functions indicates that H. pylori strains carrying biologically more active CagA are more virulent than those with less active CagA and are more closely associated with gastric carcinoma.', 'Helicobacter pylori stimulates epithelial cell migration via CagA-mediated perturbation of host cell signaling.. Helicobacter pylori CagA is delivered into gastric epithelial cells, where undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at the Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motif to interact with Src homology -containing protein tyrosine phosphatase- (SHP2) oncoprotein. CagA also binds to partitioning-defective (PAR1) polarity-regulating kinase via the CagA multimerization (CM) sequence. To investigate pathophysiological role of CagA-SHP2 and/or CagA-PAR1 interaction in H. pylori infection, we generated H. pylori isogenic strains producing a phosphorylation-resistant CagA and a CagA without CM sequence. Infection studies revealed that deregulation of epithelial cell motility was more prominent in the wild-type strain than in the mutant strains. Thus, both CagA-SHP2 and CagA-PAR1 interactions are involved in the pathogenicity of cagA-positive H. pylori.']",caga; phosphorylation; cells; tyrosine; cell; epithelial; protein; kinase; host; that,caga · phosphorylation · cells

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Over the past few decades, the incidence of adenocarcinomas of the gastroesophageal junction has rapidly increased. Barrett's esophagus is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, but the role of intestinal metaplasia of the gastric cardia as a precursor in cardia-related cancer is controversial. The aims of the present study were to examine the prevalence of intestinal metaplasia in the gastroesophageal junction and to evaluate the clinical, endoscopical and histological features of patients with intestinal metaplasia in the gastric cardia and patients with Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: consecutive patients undergoing gastroduodenoscopy were enrolled in a prospective study. Biopsy specimens were performed in the distal esophagus, squamocolumnar junction, gastric cardia, gastric corpus and antrum. RESULTS: We identified patients (%) with intestinal metaplasia in biopsies from gastric cardia and patients (%) with Barrett's esophagus. Cardia intestinal metaplasia was significantly associated with older age (p=), with intestinal metaplasia in the antrum (p=) and H. pylori infection (p<). Severe chronic cardia inflammation increased the presence of cardia intestinal metaplasia fold (OR=; p<). Patients with Barrett's esophagus were predominantly men. Barrett's esophagus presence significantly correlated with reflux symptoms(p<), endoscopic esophagitis (p<) and hiatal hernia > cm (p=). No patient had dysplasia in the gastroesophageal region.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased nearly five-fold over the last four decades in the United States. Barrett's esophagus, the replacement of the normal squamous epithelial lining with a mucus-secreting columnar epithelium, is the only known precursor to EAC. Like other parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the esophagus hosts a variety of bacteria and comparisons among published studies suggest bacterial communities in the stomach and esophagus differ. Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori in the stomach has been inversely associated with development of EAC, but the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. METHODOLOGY: The bacterial composition in the upper GI tract was characterized in a subset of participants (n=) of the Seattle Barrett's Esophagus Research cohort using broad-range 16S PCR and pyrosequencing of biopsy and brush samples collected from squamous esophagus, Barrett's esophagus, stomach corpus and stomach antrum. Three of the individuals were sampled at two separate time points. Prevalence of H. pylori infection and subsequent development of aneuploidy (n=) and EAC (n=) was examined in a larger subset of this cohort. RESULTS/SIGNIFICANCE: Within individuals, bacterial communities of the stomach and esophagus showed overlapping community membership. Despite closer proximity, the stomach antrum and corpus communities were less similar than the antrum and esophageal samples. Re-sampling of study participants revealed similar upper GI community membership in two of three cases. In this Barrett's esophagus cohort, Streptococcus and Prevotella species dominate the upper GI and the ratio of these two species is associated with waist-to-hip ratio and hiatal hernia length, two known EAC risk factors in Barrett's esophagus. H. pylori-positive individuals had a significantly decreased incidence of aneuploidy and a non-significant trend toward lower incidence of EAC."", ""Short segment Barrett's esophagus and distal gastric intestinal metaplasia.. BACKGROUND: Short segment Barrett's esophagus is defined by the presence of < cm of columnar-appearing mucosa in the distal esophagus with intestinal metaplasia on histophatological examination. Barrett's esophagus is a risk factor to develop adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. While Barrett's esophagus develops as a result of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease, intestinal metaplasia in the gastric cardia is a consequence of chronic Helicobacter pylori infection and is associated with distal gastric intestinal metaplasia. It can be difficult to determine whether short-segment columnar epithelium with intestinal metaplasia are lining the esophagus (a condition called short segment Barrett's esophagus) or the proximal stomach (a condition called intestinal metaplasia of the gastric cardia). AIMS: To study the association of short segment Barrett's esophagus (length < cm) with gastric intestinal metaplasia (antrum or body) and infection by H. pylori. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight-nine patients with short segment columnar-appearing mucosa in the esophagus, length < cm, were studied. Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease were recorded. Biopsies were obtained immediately below the squamous-columnar lining, from gastric antrum and gastric corpus for investigation of intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori. RESULTS: Forty-two from (%) patients were diagnosed with esophageal intestinal metaplasia by histopathology. The mean-age was significantly higher in the group with esophageal intestinal metaplasia. The two groups were similar in terms of gender (male: female), gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms and H. pylori infection. Gastric intestinal metaplasia (antrum or body) was diagnosed in from (%) patients in the group with esophageal intestinal metaplasia and from (%) patients in the group with esophageal columnar appearing mucosa but without intestinal metaplasia. CONCLUSION: Intestinal metaplasia is a frequent finding in patients with < cm of columnar-appearing mucosa in the distal esophagus.

The bacterial '-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (MTAN) enzyme is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-ribosidic bond of at least four different adenosine-based metabolites: S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), '-methylthioadenosine (MTA), '-deoxyadenosine ('-DOA), and -amino--deoxyfutalosine. These activities place the enzyme at the hub of seven fundamental bacterial metabolic pathways: S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) utilization, polyamine biosynthesis, the purine salvage pathway, the methionine salvage pathway, the SAM radical pathways, autoinducer- biosynthesis, and menaquinone biosynthesis. The last pathway makes MTAN essential for Helicobacter pylori viability. Although structures of various bacterial and plant MTANs have been described, the interactions between the homocysteine moiety of SAH and the '-alkylthiol binding site of MTAN have never been resolved. We have determined crystal structures of an inactive mutant form of H. pylori MTAN bound to MTA and SAH to and Å, respectively. The active form of MTAN was also crystallized in the presence of SAH, allowing the determination of the structure of a ternary enzyme-product complex resolved at Å.

This has allowed the resolution of the M. tuberculosis DHQ2 loop containing residues - for the first time. These structures show the key interactions of the aromatic ring in the active site of both enzymes and additionally reveal an important change in the conformation and flexibility of the loop that closes over substrate binding.

The loss of effectiveness of current antibiotics caused by the development of drug resistance has become a severe threat to public health. Current widely used antibiotics are surprisingly targeted at a few bacterial functions - cell wall, DNA, RNA, and protein biosynthesis - and resistance to them is widespread and well identified. There is therefore great interest in the discovery of novel drugs and therapies to tackle antimicrobial resistance, in particular drugs that target other essential processes for bacterial survival. In the past few years a great deal of effort has been focused on the discovery of new inhibitors of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, also known as the shikimic acid pathway, in which chorismic acid is synthesized. The latter compound is the synthetic precursor of L-Phe, L-Tyr, L-Phe, and other important aromatic metabolites. These enzymes are recognized as attractive targets for the development of new antibacterial agents because they are essential in important pathogenic bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori, but do not have any counterpart in human cells. This review is focused on two key enzymes of this pathway, shikimate kinase and type II dehydroquinase. An overview of the use of structure-based design and computational studies for the discovery of selective inhibitors of these enzymes will be provided.

We evaluated gastrointestinal lesions of kidney transplant candidates on dialysis. METHODS: In this study, endoscopic and pathological findings in hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with gastrointestinal symptoms on the waiting list were compared. RESULTS: The most common non-ulcerous lesions in the endoscopic examination were gastritis (%), erosive gastritis (%), duodenal erosion or duodenitis (%) and esophagitis (%). The ulcerous lesion was present in only patients. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, ulcerated lesion and non-ulcerated lesion rates were similar in both dialysis groups.

Genotype distribution was as follows: cagA- %; cagE- %; vacA s1a- %; vacA s1b- %; vacA s1c- %; vacA s2- %; vacA m1- %; vacA m2- %; vacA s1m1- %; vacA s1m2- %; vacA s2m1- %; vacA s2m2- %; iceA1- %; iceA2- %; babA2- %. CagA genotype was significantly associated with higher degrees of intestinal metaplasia, neutrophil activity, chronic inflammation and OLGIM stages. BabA2 was linked with higher H. pylori density. Strains with vacA s1m1 or vacA s1m1 + cagA positive genotypes had a significant association with peptic ulcer and vacA s2m2 with iron-deficient anemia. CONCLUSIONS: cagA, vacA s1m1 and babA2 genotypes are relatively rare in the central region of Portugal. cagA-positive strains are correlated with more severe histopathological modifications. This gene is commonly associated with vacA s1m1, and such isolates are frequently found in patients with peptic ulcer.', 'Relationship between Helicobacter pylori virulence genes and clinical outcomes in Saudi patients.. Helicobacter pylori has been strongly associated with gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers, and it is a risk factor for gastric cancer. Two major virulence factors of H. pylori have been described: the cytotoxin-associated gene product (cagA) and the vacuolating toxin (vacA). Since considerable geographic diversity in the prevalence of H. pylori virulence factors has been reported, the aim of this work was to determine if there is a significant correlation between different H. pylori virulence genes (cagA and vacA) in patients, from Saudi Arabia, and gastric clinical outcomes. H. pylor was recognized in cultures of gastric biopsies. vacA and cagA genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The cagA gene was obtained with isolates (%). The vacA s- and m- region genotypes were determined in all strains studied. Three genotypes were found: s1/m1 (%), s1/m2 (%) and s2/m2 (%). The s2/m1 genotype was not found in this study. The relation of the presence of cagA and the development of cases to gastritis and ulcer was statistically significant (P < ). The study showed a significant correlation between the vacAs1/m2 genotype and gastritis cases, and a significant correlation between vacAs1/m1 genotype and peptic ulcer cases. The results of this study might be used for the identification of high-risk patients who are infected by vacAs1/m1 genotype of H. pylori strains. In conclusion, H. pylori strains of vacA type s1 and the combination of s1/m1 were associated with peptic ulceration and the presence of cagA gene.', 'Frequency of virulence factors in Helicobacter pylori-infected patients with gastritis.. UNLABELLED: The outcome of Helicobacter pylori infection has been related to specific virulence-associated bacterial genotypes. The vacuolating cytotoxin (vacA), cagA gene, oipA and babA2 gene are important virulence factor involving gastric diseases. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between virulence factors of H. pylori and histopathological findings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gastroduodenoscopy was performed in dyspeptic patients. Antrum biopsy was obtained for detection of H. pylori, virulence factors and for histopathological assessment. The polymerase chain reaction was used to detect virulence factors of H. pylori using specific primers. RESULTS: vacA genotypes in patients infected with H. pylori were associated with cagA, iceA1 and iceA2. In the patients with H. pylori infection there was a significant relationship between cagA positivity and neutrophil activity (P = ) and chronic inflammation (P = ) and with H. pylori density (P = ). Neutrophil infiltration was found to be more severe in the s1 group than in the s2 group (P = ). Also was a significant relationship between oipA positivity and neutrophil activity (P = ) and with H. pylori density (P = ). No significant relationships were observed between other vacA genotypes and histopathological parameters. CONCLUSION: H. pylori strains showing cagA, vacA s1 and oipA positivity are associated with more severe gastritis in some histological features but virulence factors of H. pylori do not appear to determine the overall pattern of gastritis.']",dupa; virulence; strains; genes; genotypes; vaca; hopq; caga; gene; from,dupa · virulence · strains

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori is responsible for gastroduodenal diseases such as chronic gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers and also gastric malignances. During an infection, gastric mucins, especially secretory MUC5AC, are said to participate in interactions with bacterial adhesins. Recently, epithelial MUC1 mucin has also been proposed to be engaged in infection development. H. pylori surface possesses lipopolisaccharides with Lewis antigens whose role in interactions with gastric mucins has not been elucidated thoroughly so far. OBJECTIVES: To check the involvement of Lewis b and H type structures of H. pylori in adhesion of bacteria to MUC1 mucin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed on gastric juices taken from clinical patients and H. pylori strains. Bacteria were assessed for the presence of Lewis b and H type structures by ELISA test. Interactions of H. pylori with MUC1 were analyzed by sandwich ELISA method with bacteria pretreated or not with Lewis b - HSA or H type - HSA glycoconjugates. RESULTS: In the majority of the patients, the slight increase of adhesion of H. pylori to MUC1, after pretreatment of bacteria with H type glycoconjugate was observed. A statistically significant difference was revealed in one strain with a dose of conjugate 50µg/mL (P = ). The influence of Lewis b on adhesion is considered to be contradictory.

AIM: To investigate the relationship between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and mucin expression in gastric mucosa. METHODS: English Medical literature searches were conducted for gastric mucin expression in H. pylori infected people vs uninfected people. Searches were performed up to December (th) , using MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and CENTRAL. Studies comparing mucin expression in the gastric mucosa in patients positive and negative for H. pylori infection, were included. Meta-analysis was performed by using Comprehensive meta-analysis software (Version , Biostat Inc., Englewood, NJ, United States). Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated compared mucin expression in individual studies by using the random effects model. Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated using the Cochran Q-test, and it was considered to be present if the Q-test P value was less than . I() statistic was used to measure the proportion of inconsistency in individual studies, with I() > % representing substantial heterogeneity. We also calculated a potential publication bias. RESULTS: Eleven studies, which represent sub-studies of different kinds of mucin expression, were selected according to the inclusion criteria. Every kind of mucin has been considered as one study. When a specific mucin has been studied in more than one paper, we combined the results in a nested meta-analysis of this particular mucin: MUC2, MUC6, STn, Paradoxical con A, Tn, T, Type chain mucin, LeA, SLeA, LeB, AB-PAS, MUC1, and MUC5AC. The odds ratio of mucin expression in random analysis was , %CI: -, P = , higher expression in H. pylori infected patients. Odds ratio for mucin expression in H. pylori positive patients was higher for MUC6 (, %CI: -, P = ), and significantly lower for MUC5AC (, %CI: -, P = ). Thus, H. pylori infection may increase MUC6 expression and decrease MUC5AC expression by % and %, respectively. CONCLUSION: H. pylori inhibits MUC5AC expression in the gastric epithelium, and facilitates colonization. In contrast, increased MUC6 expression may help inhibiting colonization, using MUC6 antibiotics properties.', 'Polymorphisms in mucin genes in the development of gastric cancer.. Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. In areas of high prevalence, such as Japan, South Korea and China, most cases of GC are related to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), which involves well-characterized sequential stages, including infection, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and GC. Mucins are the most abundant high-molecular-weight glycoproteins in mucus, which is the first line of defense and plays a major role in blocking pathogenic factors. Normal gastric mucosa shows expression of MUC1, MUC5AC and MUC6 that is specific to cell type. However, the specific pattern of MUC1, MUC5AC and MUC6 expression is changed in gastric carcinogenesis, accompanied by de novo expression of secreted MUC2. Recent studies have provided evidence that variations in these mucin genes affect many steps of GC development, such as H. pylori infection, and gastric precancerous lesions. In this review, we focus on studies of the association between polymorphisms in mucin genes and development of GC. This information should be helpful for the early detection, surveillance, and treatment of GC.']",mucin; muc1; mucins; muc5ac; mucus; muc6; expression; gastric; tff2; muc2,mucin · muc1 · mucins

The results indicate that Lactobacillus strains showed potential anti-H. pylori activity in vitro. Lactobacillus plantarum had the largest zone of inhibition and markedly reduced the urease activity of H. pylori.

In this study, the antagonistic activities of Lactobacillus gasseri Chen, and L. plantarum were assessed by agar plate diffusion assay and tests that determined the growth and urease activity of Helicobacter pylori cocultured with lactobacilli and the adherence of H. pylori to human gastric epithelial cells in the presence of lactobacilli. The results showed that the Lactobacillus strains had significant anti-H.pylori activity, and this activity may be contributed by the cell-free supernatants (CFS) of lactobacilli and live Lactobacillus strains in vitro. The antagonistic activity of the CFS against H. pylori depended on the pH and the presence of metabolites, such as organic acids and proteases. Our results also indicated that Lactobacillus strains could inhibit H. pylori adherence human gastric epithelial cells.

Then, the anti-H. pylori effects of lactobacilli were evaluated by stool antigen test and tissue staining. RESULTS: Based on ELISA results and histological findings, a reduction of inflammation was observed. The group which was only exposed to L. rhamnosus and the one which was exposed to all three strains of Lactobacillus showed the highest antimicrobial effect on H. pylori.

Helicobacter pylori is associated with severe and chronic diseases of the stomach and duodenum such as peptic ulcer, non-cardial adenocarcinoma and gastric lymphoma, making Helicobacter pylori the only bacterial pathogen which is known to cause cancer. The worldwide rate of incidence for these diseases is extremely high and it is estimated that about half of the world's population is infected with H. pylori. Among the bacterial virulence factors is the vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA), which represents an important determinant of pathogenicity. Intensive characterization of VacA over the past years has provided insight into an ample variety of mechanisms contributing to host-pathogen interactions. The toxin is considered as an important target for ongoing research for several reasons: i) VacA displays unique features and structural properties and its mechanism of action is unrelated to any other known bacterial toxin; ii) the toxin is involved in disease progress and colonization by H. pylori of the stomach; iii) VacA is a potential and promising candidate for the inclusion as antigen in a vaccine directed against H. pylori and iv) the vacA gene is characterized by a high allelic diversity, and allelic variants contribute differently to the pathogenicity of H. pylori. Despite the accumulation of substantial data related to VacA over the past years, several aspects of VacA-related activity have been characterized only to a limited extent. The biologically most significant effect of VacA activity on host cells is the formation of membrane pores and the induction of vacuole formation. This review discusses recent findings and advances on structure-function relations of the H. pylori VacA toxin, in particular with a view to membrane channel formation, oligomerization, receptor binding and apoptosis."", 'An Overview of Helicobacter pylori VacA Toxin Biology.. The VacA toxin secreted by Helicobacter pylori enhances the ability of the bacteria to colonize the stomach and contributes to the pathogenesis of gastric adenocarcinoma and peptic ulcer disease. The amino acid sequence and structure of VacA are unrelated to corresponding features of other known bacterial toxins. VacA is classified as a pore-forming toxin, and many of its effects on host cells are attributed to formation of channels in intracellular sites. The most extensively studied VacA activity is its capacity to stimulate vacuole formation, but the toxin has many additional effects on host cells. Multiple cell types are susceptible to VacA, including gastric epithelial cells, parietal cells, T cells, and other types of immune cells. This review focuses on the wide range of VacA actions that are detectable in vitro, as well as actions of VacA in vivo that are relevant for H. pylori colonization of the stomach and development of gastric disease.', 'Pleiotropic actions of Helicobacter pylori vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA.. Helicobacter pylori produces a vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA, and most virulent H. pylori strains secrete VacA. VacA binds to two types of receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP), RPTPalpha and RPTPbeta, on the surface of host cells. VacA bound to RPTPbeta, relocates and concentrates in lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. VacA causes vacuolization, membrane anion-selective channel and pore formation, and disruption of endosomal and lysosomal activity in host cells. Secreted VacA is processed into p33 and p55 fragments. The p55 domain not only plays a role in binding to target cells but also in the formation of oligomeric structures and anionic membrane channels. Oral administration of VacA to wild-type mice, but not to RPTPbeta knockout mice, resulted in gastric ulcers, in agreement with the clinical effect of VacA. VacA with s1/m1 allele has more potent cytotoxic activity in relation to peptic ulcer disease and appears to be associated with human gastric cancer. VacA activates pro-apoptotic Bcl- family proteins, and induces apoptosis via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. VacA can disrupt other signal transduction pathways; VacA activates p38 MAPK, enhancing production of IL- and PGE(), and PI3K/Akt, suppressing GSK-3beta activity. VacA has immunomodulatory actions on T cells and other immune cells, possibly contributing to the chronic infection seen with this organism. H. pylori virulence factors including VacA and CagA, which is encoded by cytotoxin-associated gene A, along with host genetic and environmental factors, constitute a complex network to regulate chronic gastric injury and inflammation, which is involved in a multistep process leading to gastric carcinogenesis.']",vaca; toxin; vacuolating; cytotoxin; vacuolation; cells; mitochondrial; p55; membrane; mitochondria,vaca · toxin · vacuolating

BACKGROUND: The role of preoperative upper gastrointestinal endoscopy before bariatric surgery is still debated, and a consensus among the international scientific community is lacking. The aims of this study, conducted in three different geographic areas, were to analyze data regarding the pathological endoscopic findings and report their impact on the decision-making process and surgical management, in terms of delay in surgical operation, modification of the intended bariatric procedure, or contraindication to surgery. METHODS: This is a multicenter cross-sectional study using data obtained from three prospective databases. The preoperative endoscopic reports, patient demographics, Body Mass Index, type of surgery, and Helicobacter pylori status were collected. Endoscopic findings were categorized into four groups: () normal endoscopy, () abnormal findings not requiring a change in the surgical approach, () clinically important lesions that required a change in surgical management or further investigations or therapy prior to surgery, and () findings that contraindicated surgery. RESULTS: Between and , data on patients were analyzed. In all of the enrolled bariatric institutions, preoperative endoscopy was performed routinely.

INTRODUCTION: The role of preoperative upper-gastrointestinal (GI) gastroscopy has been discussed with controversy in bariatric surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of upper-GI pathologies detected via endoscopy prior to bariatric surgery along with their clinical significance for patients' management. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In our single center prospectively established database of obese patients, who underwent bariatric surgery from January to December , we retrospectively analyzed the perioperative endoscopic findings along with their influence on patients' management. RESULTS: In total, obese patients with median BMI (body mass index) of kg/m2 [range -] received an upper-GI endoscopy prior to bariatric surgery. Among the surgical procedures, laparoscopic Roux-Y-gastric bypass (%; n = ) was the most frequent operation. Endoscopically detected pathological conditions were peptic ulcer % (/), Helicobacter pylori (Hp) gastritis % (/), and gastric or duodenal polyps % (/).

Esophageal adenocarcinomas were detected in cases (%). Change of the operative strategy due to endoscopically or histologically detected pathologic findings had to be performed in cases (%). CONCLUSION: Preoperative upper-GI endoscopy identifies a wide range of abnormal endoscopic findings in obese patients, which may have a significant impact on decision-making, particularly regarding the most suitable bariatric procedure and the appropriate follow-up.

Abnormal findings that changed the medical management before surgery were found in patients (%), including inflammation and/or ulcers. This group included of patients with gastritis who were treated for Helicobacter pylori found within the biopsy specimen. Findings that changed the surgical approach were found in patient, and findings of severe ulcerations that postponed surgery were found in another patient. Of the patients, actually underwent bariatric surgery, including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in % and adjustable gastric banding in %. During follow-up, gastric bypass patients (%) developed ulceration. Both gastritis and duodenitis, but not the presence of H. pylori, was statistically related to ulcer formation (Fisher's exact test). CONCLUSION: In this consecutive series of successful screening EGDs, positive findings led to a change in medical treatment in a significant number of patients (%), but a change in the timing of surgery or the surgical technique in relatively few (<%). In addition, a significant correlation between gastritis and postoperative anastamotic ulceration suggests a causative link, with implications arguing for stronger medical therapy.

BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy is considered the most effective screening method for colorectal polyps. However, the longevity and complexity of the procedure makes it less desirable to screen for colorectal polyps in the general population. Therefore, it is essential to identify other independent risk factors. In this study, we explored the link between Hp infection, atrophic gastritis, and colorectal polyps to identify a new potential risk factors of colorectal polyps. METHODS: In this study, atrophic gastritis and intestinal polyps were diagnosed by endoscopy and pathology. All the patients in this retrospective study were divided into sub-groups based on the presence of colorectal polyps. The correlation between polyps and atrophic gastritis was analyzed using the chi-square test and Kruskal-Wallis test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to compare the predictive value for colorectal polyps between Hp infection and atrophic gastritis. Binary logistic regression was utilized to identify independent risk factors for colorectal polyps. RESULTS: Patients with colorectal polyps were primarily male with advanced age, and the number of patients with colorectal polyps had a higher association with smoking, alcohol drinking, and Hp infection than the control group. A positive correlation between the number of colorectal polyps and the severity of atrophic gastritis was observed.

Evidence suggests the following beneficial effects of probiotics: normalization of the intestinal microflora, ability to block the invasion of potential pathogens in the gut, prophylactic or therapeutic treatment for several types of diarrhea, relief of symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, amelioration of lactose intolerance, prevention of colon cancer, modulation of immune function, inhibition of Helicobacter pylori, and possible enhancement of calcium absorption and reduction of blood cholesterol levels. Mechanisms for the above benefits have been proposed, but none has been proven. An adequate level of viable bacteria in a probiotic product and an appropriate daily dose are critical to achieve a health benefit. Because probiotics are not known to be pathogenic and their upper tolerable level is high, they could be promoted as a beneficial food supplement. Currently, no disease-prevention or therapeutic claim for probiotics is legally allowed.', 'Probiotic Bacterial and Fungal Strains: Claims with Evidence.. BACKGROUND: Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit for the host. This review summarizes current (i.e. published in the last years) key evidence on probiotic efficacy and its safety in adults and children. To identify relevant data, searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library databases were performed in August to locate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or their meta-analyses. The focus was on commonly used, well-specified, bacterial and yeast probiotics for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. The MEDLINE database was also searched for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, developed by scientific societies in the same timeframe. Data on safety of probiotics were obtained from a document developed by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. KEY MESSAGES: A number of relevant RCTs and meta-analyses are available. Saccharomyces boulardii is the most studied yeast probiotic, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is the most studied bacterial probiotic. For both, the best documented fact is their efficacy for the treatment of acute gastroenteritis, especially in children, and for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, both in adults and children. There is some evidence to support the use of probiotics to prevent or treat other diseases, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, infantile colic, Helicobacter pylori infection, and irritable bowel syndrome, but further studies are needed to identify which strain(s) is/are the most effective. Data on safety, particularly long-term safety, are limited. The risk of side effects is greater in people who have severe underlying health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence on bacterial and yeast probiotics has considerably expanded during recent years. Accumulated data allow one to make informed decisions about the effectiveness of probiotics and about how to reduce the use of those without proven efficacy.', 'Indications for the use of probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases.. Probiotics are live microbial organisms that are present in foods or dietary supplements and that confer health benefits to the host when ingested in sufficient quantities. Probiotics can be bacterial (e.g. Bifidobacteria spp. and Lactobacillus spp.) or yeasts (e.g. Saccharomyces boulardii). The administration of probiotics is often believed to be by and large beneficial for individuals with inflammatory or infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. These positive effects are generally attributed to the ability of probiotics to regulate intestinal permeability, normalize host intestinal flora, improve gut immune barrier function, and equilibrate the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Of note, however, these claims are not always substantiated by findings from properly conducted clinical trials. Of particular importance, even when results from randomized controlled trials support the beneficial effects of a particular probiotic for a specific indication, the benefits achieved by the probiotic are generally not translatable to other probiotic formulations. This review discusses the gastrointestinal indications for probiotic use and describes the level of evidence that supports the use of specific probiotics for these indications. Several indications are addressed, including enteric infections, gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, necrotizing enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and irritable bowel syndrome.']",probiotics; probiotic; diarrhea; bowel; prevention; antibioticassociated; gastrointestinal; health; microbiota; lactobacillus,probiotics · probiotic · diarrhea

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori is a gut bacterium that is the primary cause of gastric cancer. H. pylori infection has been consistently associated with lack of access to sanitation and clean drinking water. In this study, we conducted time-series sampling of drinking water in Lima, Peru, to examine trends of H. pylori contamination and other water characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Drinking water samples were collected from a single faucet in Lima's Lince district days per week from June to May , and pH, temperature, free available chlorine, and conductivity were measured. Quantities of H. pylori in all water samples were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Relationships between the presence/absence and quantity of H. pylori and water characteristics in the - period were examined using regression methods accounting for the time-series design. RESULTS: Forty-nine of (%) of drinking water samples were contaminated with H. pylori. Statistical analyses identified no associations between sampling date and the likelihood of contamination with H. pylori. Statistically significant relationships were found between lower temperatures and a lower likelihood of the presence of H. pylori (P < .), as well as between higher pH and higher quantities of H. pylori (P < .). CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided evidence of the presence of H. pylori DNA in the drinking water of a single drinking water faucet in the Lince district of Lima. However, no seasonal trends were observed. Further studies are needed to determine the presence of H. pylori in other drinking water sources in other districts in Lima, as well as to determine the viability of H. pylori in these water sources. Such studies would potentially allow for better understanding and estimates of the risk of infection due to exposure to H. pylori in drinking water."", ""Detection of Helicobacter pylori in city water, dental units' water, and bottled mineral water in Isfahan, Iran.. Helicobacter pylori infection in human is one of the most common infections worldwide. However, the origin and transmission of this bacterium has not been clearly explained. One of the suggested theories is transmission via water. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence rate of H. pylori in tap water, dental units' water, and bottled mineral water in Iran. In the present study, totally water samples were collected in Isfahan province and tested for H. pylori by cultural method and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by the detection of the ureC (glmM) gene. Using cultural method totally cultures were positive. Two out of tap water samples (%), out of dental units' water (%) samples, and out of (%) from water cooler in public places were found to be contaminated with H. pylori. H. pylori ureC gene was detected in (%) of water samples including tap water (%), dental units' water (%), refrigerated water with filtration, and (%) water cooler in public places samples. This may be due to the coccoid form of bacteria which is detected by PCR method."", 'Detection of Helicobacter pylori in drinking water treatment plants in Bogotá, Colombia, using cultural and molecular techniques.. Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common causes of chronic bacterial infection in humans, and a predisposing factor for peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. The infection has been consistently associated with lack of access to clean water and proper sanitation. H. pylori has been detected in surface water, wastewater and drinking water. However, its ability to survive in an infectious state in the environment is hindered because it rapidly loses its cultivability. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of cultivable and therefore viable H. pylori in influent and effluent water from drinking water treatment plants (DWTP). A total of influent and effluent water samples were collected from three drinking water treatment plants located at Bogotá city, Colombia. Specific detection of H. pylori was achieved by culture, qPCR and FISH techniques. Fifty-six positive H. pylori cultures were obtained from the water samples. Characteristic colonies were covered by the growth of a large number of other bacteria present in the water samples, making isolation difficult to perform. Thus, the mixed cultures were submitted to Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH) and qPCR analysis, followed by sequencing of the amplicons for confirmation. By qPCR, water samples, both from the influent and the effluent, were positive for the presence of H. pylori. The results of our study demonstrate that viable H. pylori cells were present in both, influent and effluent water samples obtained from drinking water treatment plants in Bogotá and provide further evidence that contaminated water may act as a transmission vehicle for H. pylori. Moreover, FISH and qPCR methods result rapid and specific techniques to identify H. pylori from complex environmental samples such as influent water.']",water; drinking; samples; wastewater; transmission; river; viable; environmental; pcr; contamination,water · drinking · samples

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a crucial role in understanding disease pathogenesis, genetic mechanisms, guiding drug design, and other biochemical processes, thus, the identification of PPIs is of great importance. With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology, a large amount of PPIs sequence data has been accumulated. Researchers have designed many experimental methods to detect PPIs by using these sequence data, hence, the prediction of PPIs has become a research hotspot in proteomics. However, since traditional experimental methods are both time-consuming and costly, it is difficult to analyze and predict the massive amount of PPI data quickly and accurately. To address these issues, many computational systems employing machine learning knowledge were widely applied to PPIs prediction, thereby improving the overall recognition rate. In this paper, a novel and efficient computational technology is presented to implement a protein interaction prediction system using only protein sequence information. First, the Position-Specific Iterated Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (PSI-BLAST) was employed to generate a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) containing protein evolutionary information from the initial protein sequence. Second, we used a novel data processing feature representation scheme, MatFLDA, to extract the essential information of PSSM for protein sequences and obtained five training and five testing datasets by adopting a five-fold cross-validation method. Finally, the random fern (RFs) classifier was employed to infer the interactions among proteins, and a model called MatFLDA_RFs was developed. The proposed MatFLDA_RFs model achieved good prediction performance with % average accuracy on Yeast dataset and % average accuracy on H. pylori dataset, which effectively outperformed other existing computational methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is capable of yielding better prediction results of PPIs, which provides an effective tool for the detection of new PPIs and the in-depth study of proteomics. Finally, we also developed a web server for the proposed model to predict protein-protein interactions, which is freely accessible online at http://.:/webserver/MatFLDA_RFs.', ""Improved protein-protein interactions prediction via weighted sparse representation model combining continuous wavelet descriptor and PseAA composition.. BACKGROUND: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential to most biological processes. Since bioscience has entered into the era of genome and proteome, there is a growing demand for the knowledge about PPI network. High-throughput biological technologies can be used to identify new PPIs, but they are expensive, time-consuming, and tedious. Therefore, computational methods for predicting PPIs have an important role. For the past years, an increasing number of computational methods such as protein structure-based approaches have been proposed for predicting PPIs. The major limitation in principle of these methods lies in the prior information of the protein to infer PPIs. Therefore, it is of much significance to develop computational methods which only use the information of protein amino acids sequence. RESULTS: Here, we report a highly efficient approach for predicting PPIs. The main improvements come from the use of a novel protein sequence representation by combining continuous wavelet descriptor and Chou's pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), and from adopting weighted sparse representation based classifier (WSRC). This method, cross-validated on the PPIs datasets of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Human and H. pylori, achieves an excellent results with accuracies as high as %, % and % respectively, significantly better than previously proposed methods. Extensive experiments are performed to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. CONCLUSIONS: The outstanding results yield by our model that the proposed feature extraction method combing two kinds of descriptors have strong expression ability and are expected to provide comprehensive and effective information for machine learning-based classification models. In addition, the prediction performance in the comparison experiments shows the well cooperation between the combined feature and WSRC. Thus, the proposed method is a very efficient method to predict PPIs and may be a useful supplementary tool for future proteomics studies."", 'Sequence-based prediction of protein-protein interactions using weighted sparse representation model combined with global encoding.. BACKGROUND: Proteins are the important molecules which participate in virtually every aspect of cellular function within an organism in pairs. Although high-throughput technologies have generated considerable protein-protein interactions (PPIs) data for various species, the processes of experimental methods are both time-consuming and expensive. In addition, they are usually associated with high rates of both false positive and false negative results. Accordingly, a number of computational approaches have been developed to effectively and accurately predict protein interactions. However, most of these methods typically perform worse when other biological data sources (e.g., protein structure information, protein domains, or gene neighborhoods information) are not available. Therefore, it is very urgent to develop effective computational methods for prediction of PPIs solely using protein sequence information. RESULTS: In this study, we present a novel computational model combining weighted sparse representation based classifier (WSRC) and global encoding (GE) of amino acid sequence. Two kinds of protein descriptors, composition and transition, are extracted for representing each protein sequence. On the basis of such a feature representation, novel weighted sparse representation based classifier is introduced to predict protein interaction class. When the proposed method was evaluated with the PPIs data of S. cerevisiae, Human and H. pylori, it achieved high prediction accuracies of , and % respectively. Extensive experiments were performed for cross-species PPIs prediction and the prediction accuracies were also very promising. CONCLUSIONS: To further evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we then compared its performance with the method based on support vector machine (SVM). The results show that the proposed method achieved a significant improvement. Thus, the proposed method is a very efficient method to predict PPIs and may be a useful supplementary tool for future proteomics studies.']",proteinprotein; prediction; network; ppis; interactions; networks; protein; method; datasets; proposed,proteinprotein · prediction · network

Helicobacter pylori infection and disease outcome are mediated by a complex interplay between bacterial, host, and environmental factors. Over the past year, our understanding of this complex interplay has been improved by a variety of studies focusing on both host and bacterial factors. These include studies assessing novel virulence factors as well as those most frequently associated with severity of disease outcome including cagA and the cag pathogenicity island, and the vacuolating cytotoxin. Several studies have focused on regulation of virulence factors by environmental factors. In addition, mechanisms by which bacterial virulence factors influence the host response and disease, by inducing epigenetic changes, autophagy and altered oxidative stress have also been elucidated.

Helicobacter pylori induces chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa, but only a proportion of infected individuals develop peptic ulcer disease or gastric carcinoma. Reasons underlying these observations include differences in bacterial pathogenicity as well as in host susceptibility. Numerous studies published in the last year provided new insight into H. pylori virulence factors, their interaction with the host and consequences in pathogenesis. These include the role of bacterial genetic diversity in host colonization and persistence, outer membrane proteins and modulation of adhesin expression, new aspects of VacA functions, and CagA and its phosphorylation-dependent and -independent cellular effects.

Peritonitis due to gastroduodenal ulcer perforation disease is a rare entity in pediatric surgery. In Senegal, no study has been dedicated to ulcer complications in children. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of perforated peptic ulcer in patients less than years old. This retrospective study was conducted in the Surgical Emergencies and Paediatric Surgery Department at Aristide Le Dantec University Hospital Center in Dakar, Senegal, during a period of years (January to December ). We found children who presented perforated gastroduodenal ulcer: females and male. The average age of these patients was years (range, - years). No family history was found. We noted cases of perforated duodenal ulcer and one perforated gastric ulcer. The clinical diagnosis was suspected based on a peritoneal irritation syndrome. A plain x-ray of the abdomen was taken in all patients, which objectified a pneumoperitoneum image in cases. The leukocytosis was constant. Treatment in all patients consisted on pre-, intra-, and postoperative intensive care, supra- and infraumbilical midline laparotomy, which allowed us to perform a debridement-suture of the gap followed by epiploplasty and extensive washing with lukewarm physiologic serum. Adjuvant therapy based on anti-ulcer and antibiotic therapy was initiated. Bacteriological examination of peritoneal fluid isolated a polymicrobial flora. Helicobacter pylori was not isolated. Histological examination of the biopsied perforation edges showed a benign ulcer in all cases. The follow-up endoscopy was performed weeks after surgery and showed cicatrization of the ulcer in all patients. After a mean of years, no recurrence was noted.

This study aimed to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (C-LAMP) assay for the detection of H. pylori in tissue biopsy samples. METHODS: In total, gastric biopsy samples were collected, and the performance of the C-LAMP assay was compared with that of conventional diagnostic methods, including culture, PCR, and rapid urease test (CLO test).

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with Aß peptide and Tau protein deposits, but the initial process inducing the disease and ultimately neurodegeneration has not yet been elucidated. An infectious hypothesis is suggested by the alteration of the blood-brain barrier and the activation of neuroinflammation in the brain, which could play a role, especially in the decrease of Aß peptide clearance. Several viral or bacterial agents have been incriminated, including Helicobacter pylori. Infection by H. pylori is acquired during childhood and often lifetime persisting, inducing a chronic gastric inflammation, which remains asymptomatic in approximately % of cases. However H. pylori infection can induce systemic inflammation and increase homocysteine levels, contributing to worsen AD lesions. Association between H. pylori and AD is suggested by ) epidemiologic studies, which show higher AD prevalence and more pronounced cognitive impairment in infected than in non-infected subjects; ) experimental studies in murine models: a) in a first study we evaluated the impact of H. pylori infection on the brain of non-AD predisposed C57BL/6J mice.

Ninety-seven patients did not have dementia and were considered controls. On univariate analysis, average age and the proportion of males were significantly higher in AD patients than in controls. There was no difference in the prevalence of H. pylori infection between patients with AD and controls (% vs. %, p = , crude odds ratio (OR), ). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that older age and male sex, but not H. pylori status, were significantly associated with AD (p < , p = , p = , respectively). The prevalence of H. pylori infection did not differ between AD patients and controls among Japanese subjects. The high prevalence of H. pylori in controls may contribute to the discrepancy with previous reports."", ""Implications of Microorganisms in Alzheimer's Disease.. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a deadly brain degenerative disorder that leads to brain shrinkage and dementia. AD is manifested with hyperphosphorylated tau protein levels and amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide buildup in the hippocampus and cortex regions of the brain. The nervous tissue of AD patients also contains fungal proteins and DNA which are linked to bacterial infections, suggesting that polymicrobial infections also occur in the brains of those with AD. Both immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques were employed to assess fungal and bacterial infections in the brain tissue of AD patients and non-AD controls, with the most prevalent fungus genera detected in AD patients being Alternaria, Botrytis, Candida, and Malassezia. Interestingly, Fusarium was the most common genus detected in the control group. Both AD patients and controls were also detectable for Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroides for bacterial infection. At the family level, Burkholderiaceae and Staphylococcaceae exhibited higher levels in the brains of those with AD than the brains of the control group. Accordingly, there is thought to be a viscous cycle of uncontrolled neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the brain, caused by agents such as the herpes simplex virus type (HSV1), Chlamydophilapneumonia, and Spirochetes, and the presence of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), which is associated with an increased proinflammatory response in the immune system. Systemic proinflammatory cytokines are produced by microorganisms such as Cytomegalovirus, Helicobacter pylori, and those related to periodontal infections. These can then cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and lead to the onset of dementia. Here, we reviewed the relationship between the etiology of AD and microorganisms (such as bacterial pathogens, Herpesviridae viruses, and periodontal pathogens) according to the evidence available to understand the pathogenesis of AD. These findings might guide a targeted anti-inflammatory therapeutic approach to AD.""]",ad; dementia; alzheimers; cognitive; brain; neurodegenerative; disease; tau; between; impairment,dementia · alzheimers · cognitive

Gastric cancer (GC) remains a major global health burden, with high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in regions with prevalent Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. While H. pylori has long been recognized as a primary carcinogenic agent, recent research has underscored the broader contribution of the gastric microbiota to gastric carcinogenesis. Alterations in the microbial community, or dysbiosis, contribute to chronic inflammation, immune modulation, and epithelial transformation through a range of mechanisms, including disruption of mucosal integrity, activation of oncogenic signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K/Akt, NF-κB, STAT3), and epigenetic alterations. Furthermore, microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, and lactate, play dual roles in either promoting or suppressing tumorigenesis. Oral and gut-derived microbes, translocated to the gastric niche, have been implicated in reshaping the gastric microenvironment and exacerbating disease progression. The composition of the microbiota also influences responses to cancer immunotherapy, suggesting that microbial profiles can serve as both prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Emerging strategies, such as probiotics, dietary interventions, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), offer new avenues for restoring microbial balance and enhancing therapy response. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the complex interplay between microbiota and gastric cancer development and emphasizes the potential of microbiome modulation in both preventive and therapeutic frameworks."", 'Gut microbiota in gastric cancer: from pathogenesis to precision medicine.. Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant global health burden, driven by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and microbial factors. Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of gut microbiota in gastric carcinogenesis, as microbial dysbiosis disrupts gastrointestinal homeostasis, fuels chronic inflammation, and promotes immunomodulation and metabolic reprogramming. Helicobacter pylori, a key microbial player, initiates tumorigenic pathways through reactive oxygen species production and the manipulation of dietary and microbial metabolites, leading to epigenetic and genetic alterations. Targeting gut microbiota has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, with interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, dietary modifications, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) showing potential in restoring microbial balance and attenuating tumor progression. Furthermore, advances in microbiota research have identified microbial biomarkers as valuable tools for early diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment of GC. This review evaluates therapeutic strategies for microbiota modulation, assesses its diagnostic and prognostic potential, and highlights current gaps in the field. It also advocates for the integration of microbiota-targeted therapies into clinical practice, emphasizing their transformative potential in the prevention and management of GC. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of gut microbiota in GC and to guide future research and clinical applications.', 'Role of the Gastric Microbiome in Gastric Cancer: From Carcinogenesis to Treatment.. The development of sequencing technology has expanded our knowledge of the human gastric microbiome, which is now known to play a critical role in the maintenance of homeostasis, while alterations in microbial community composition can promote the development of gastric diseases. Recently, carcinogenic effects of gastric microbiome have received increased attention. Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide with a high mortality rate. Helicobacter pylori is a well-recognized risk factor for GC. More than half of the global population is infected with H. pylori, which can modulate the acidity of the stomach to alter the gastric microbiome profile, leading to H. pylori-associated diseases. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that bacteria other than H. pylori and their metabolites also contribute to gastric carcinogenesis. Therefore, clarifying the contribution of the gastric microbiome to the development and progression of GC can lead to improvements in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge regarding changes in the microbial composition of the stomach caused by H. pylori infection, the carcinogenic effects of H. pylori and non-H. pylori bacteria in GC, as well as the potential therapeutic role of gastric microbiome in H. pylori infection and GC.']",microbiota; microbial; microbiome; gc; gastric; cancer; composition; bacteria; carcinogenesis; diversity,microbiota · microbial · microbiome

Helicobacter pylori has an impressive ability to persist chronically in the human stomach. Similar characteristics are associated with biofilm formation in other bacteria. The H. pylori biofilm process, however, is poorly understood. To gain insight into this mode of growth, we carried out comparative transcriptomic analysis between H. pylori biofilm and planktonic cells, using the mouse-colonizing strain SS1. Optimal biofilm formation was obtained with a low concentration of serum and days of growth, conditions that caused both biofilm and planktonic cells to be ∼% coccoid. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis found that % of genes were differentially expressed between biofilm and planktonic cell transcriptomes. Biofilm-downregulated genes included those involved in metabolism and translation, suggesting these cells have low metabolic activity. Biofilm-upregulated genes included those whose products were predicted to be at the cell envelope, involved in regulating a stress response, and surprisingly, genes related to formation of the flagellar apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy visualized flagella that appeared to be a component of the biofilm matrix, supported by the observation that an aflagellated mutant displayed a less robust biofilm with no apparent filaments. We observed flagella in the biofilm matrix of additional H. pylori strains, supporting that flagellar use is widespread. Our data thus support a model in which H. pylori biofilm involves a multigene stress-biased response and that flagella play an important role in H. pylori biofilm formation.IMPORTANCE Biofilms, communities of bacteria that are embedded in a hydrated matrix of extracellular polymeric substances, pose a substantial health risk and are key contributors to many chronic and recurrent infections. Chronicity and recalcitrant infections are also common features associated with the ulcer-causing human pathogen H. pylori However, relatively little is known about the role of biofilms in H. pylori pathogenesis, as well as the biofilm structure itself and the genes associated with this mode of growth. In the present study, we found that H. pylori biofilm cells highly expressed genes related to cell envelope and stress response, as well as those encoding the flagellar apparatus. Flagellar filaments were seen in high abundance in the biofilm. Flagella are known to play a role in initial biofilm formation, but typically are downregulated after that state. H. pylori instead appears to have coopted these structures for nonmotility roles, including a role building a robust biofilm.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Biofilm Formation in Helicobacter pylori.. BACKGROUND: Biofilm formation in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) helps bacteria survive antibiotic exposure and supports bacterial colonization and persistence in the stomach. Most of the published articles have focused on one aspect of the biofilm. Therefore, we conducted the current study to better understand the mechanism of biofilm formation, how the biofilm contributes to antibiotic resistance, and how the biofilm modifies the medication delivery mechanism. METHODS: We conducted a literature review analysis of the published articles on the Helicobacter pylori biofilm between and from the PubMed database to retrieve eligible articles. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, two hundred and seventy-three articles were eligible for our study. RESULTS: The results showed that biofilm formation starts as adhesion and progresses through micro-colonies, maturation, and dispersion in a planktonic form. Moreover, specific genes modulate each phase of biofilm formation. Few studies have shown that mechanisms, such as quorum sensing and diffusible signal factors, enhance coordination among bacteria when switching from biofilm to planktonic states. Different protein expressions were also observed between planktonic and biofilm strains, and the biofilm architecture was supported by exopolysaccharides, extracellular DNA, and outer membrane vesicles. CONCLUSIONS: This infrastructure is responsible for the increased survival of bacteria, especially in harsh environments or in the presence of antibiotics. Therefore, understanding the biofilm formation for H. pylori is crucial. This study illustrates biofilm formation in H. pylori to help improve the treatment of H. pylori infection.', 'Helicobacter pylori Biofilm Formation Is Differentially Affected by Common Culture Conditions, and Proteins Play a Central Role in the Biofilm Matrix.. The concept of Helicobacter pylori biofilm formation is relatively new. To help provide a foundation for future biofilm studies, we characterized the biofilm formation ability of a common H. pylori lab strain, G27. The goal of this study was to evaluate biofilm formation by G27 in response to common culture conditions and to explore the biofilm matrix. Our results indicate that while various types of growth media did not dramatically affect biofilm formation, surface selection had a significant effect on the final biofilm mass. Furthermore, enzymatic assays and confocal microscopy revealed that proteins appear to be the primary structural component of the H. pylori extracellular matrix; extracellular DNA (eDNA) and polysaccharides were also present but appear to play a secondary role. Finally, we found that two well-characterized antibiofilm cationic peptides differentially affected early and late-stage biofilms. Together these results provide interesting avenues for future investigations that will seek to understand H. pylori biofilm formation.IMPORTANCE The study of H. pylori biofilm formation is still in its infancy. As such, there is great variability in how biofilm assays are performed across labs. While several groups have begun to investigate factors that influence H. pylori biofilm formation, it is not yet understood how H. pylori biofilm formation may vary based on commonly used conditions. These inconsistencies lead to difficulties in interpretation and comparison between studies. Here, we set out to characterize biofilm formation by a commonly available lab strain, G27. Our findings provide novel insight into optimal biofilm conditions, the biofilm matrix, and possible mechanisms to block or disrupt biofilm formation.']",biofilm; biofilms; formation; planktonic; ability; biofilmforming; that; resistance; microscopy; strains,biofilm · biofilms · formation

HIGHLIGHTS What is already known about this subject?Celiac disease (CD) has a high clinical and histological diversity and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive.H. pylori is a bacterium that chronically infect gastric and duodenal mucosa activating both a Th1/Th17 and T-reg pathways.The role of H. pylori (and the effect of their virulence factors) in CD have not yet completely elucidated.What are the new findings?cagA+ H. pylori strains are associated to milder histological damage in infected CD patients.In active-CD patients the presence of cagA+ H. pylori is associated to an increase in T-reg markers, contrasting with a downregulation in cagA+ infected potential-CD individuals.How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?The identification of microbiological factors that could modulate inflammation and clinical expression of CD may be used in the future as preventive strategies or as supplementary treatment in patients that cannot achieve complete remission, contributing to the better care of these patients. Background: Mechanisms underlying the high clinical and histological diversity of celiac disease (CD) remain elusive. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) chronically infects gastric and duodenal mucosa and has been associated with protection against some immune-mediated conditions, but its role (specifically of cagA+ strains) in CD is unclear. Objective: To assess the relationship between gastric Hp infection (cagA+ strains) and duodenal histological damage in patients with CD. Design: Case-control study including patients with active-CD, potential-CD and non-celiac individuals. Clinical presentation, HLA genotype, Hp/cagA gene detection in gastric mucosa, duodenal histology, Foxp3 positive cells and TGF-β expression in duodenal lamina propria were analyzed. Results: We recruited patients, active-CD, potential-CD, and non-CD controls. Hp detection was similar in the three groups (~-%), but cagA+ strains were more common in infected potential-CD than in active-CD (/ vs. /; p = ) and non-CD (/; p = ). Among active-CD patients, Foxp3 positivity was significantly higher in subjects with cagA+ Hp+ compared to cagA- Hp+ (p < ) and Hp- (p < ). In cagA+ Hp+ individuals, Foxp3 positivity was also higher comparing active- to potential-CD (p < ). TGF-β expression in duodenum was similar in active-CD with cagA+ Hp+ compared to Hp- and was significantly downregulated in cagA+ potential-CD subjects compared to other groups. Conclusion: Hp infection rates were similar among individuals with/without CD, but infection with cagA+ strains was associated with milder histological damage in celiac patients infected by Hp, and in active-CD cases with higher expression of T-reg markers. Results suggest that infection by cagA+ Hp may be protective for CD progression, or conversely, that these strains are prone to colonize intestinal mucosa with less severe damage.', 'Helicobacter pylori infection in children with celiac disease.. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in children with celiac disease (CD) and to examine the role of H. pylori infection in clinical, laboratory and histopathological presentations of CD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data on children with CD and children who underwent endoscopy were compared for the prevalence and gastric histology pattern of H. pylori. Clinical presentation, laboratory and histological findings of CD children with and without H. pylori infection were compared. RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects (%) in the CD group and subjects (%) in the control group had H. pylori gastritis. Gastric metaplasia is higher in CD patients with H. pylori gastritis (%) than in patients without H. pylori gastritis (%) and in the control group (%) (p< for all groups). Abdominal distension is more common at initial admission in CD patients with H. pylori gastritis (% versus %, p<). No significant difference was found between H. pylori (+) and (-) CD patients in terms of prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. Only mild duodenal histological findings were more common in H. pylori patients (% versus %, p<). CONCLUSIONS: CD may be associated with H. pylori gastritis, but it does not affect the clinical presentation of the disease, except for abdominal distension; CD is associated with mild duodenal lesions. A gluten-free diet improves the symptoms in all patients independently of the presence of H. pylori gastritis. Gastric metaplasia increases in the presence of H. pylori gastritis. Further prospective studies are needed to examine the clinical and histopathological outcomes of gastric metaplasia associated with H. pylori gastritis in CD patients.', 'Celiac disease and Helicobacter pylori infection in children: Is there any Association?. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection can influence the inflammatory and immune responses in the gut and may therefore play a role in the development of gluten-related enteropathy in genetically susceptible individuals. Our objective was to assess the relationship between celiac disease and HP infection in children. METHODS: Children (- years) diagnosed as celiac disease (CD) (n = ) with submission of gastric and duodenal biopsies and duodenal histology having Marsh grade III features were eligible for the study. Non-celiac patients referred for endoscopy were selected as controls. We studied proportion of HP prevalence in children with confirmed CD as compared with HP prevalence in reference group comprising non-celiac children referred for endoscopy. We also evaluated predictors of HP infection in children with celiac disease. RESULTS: Of the participants with CD, gastric HP was seen in (%) patients. The prevalence of HP in patients without CD (%, P < ) was significantly higher. Among patients with CD, HP infection was most frequent in patients with Marsh IIIa. In the stepwise regression analysis for risk factors of HP infection in CD patients: presence of gastritis, hemoglobin, and absence of scalloping were found to be independent predictors in a multivariate setup. CONCLUSION: Celiac disease and gastric HP infection have inverse relationship that raises the question whether development of HP infection confers protection against CD.']",cd; celiac; disease; intraepithelial; duodenal; lymphocytic; lymphocytosis; coeliac; villous; patients,celiac · disease · intraepithelial

Entire microbial burden from several simultaneous chronic infections could be more important than a single infection in promoting atherosclerosis. No study has been done in Indian population, investigating the association of various chronic infections with CAD. We therefore evaluated the presence of markers of chronic infections in CAD patients having no conventional risk factors and healthy individuals in a tertiary care hospital in north India. METHODS: Seropositivity to IgG antibodies was investigated for Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Helicobacter pylori in CAD patients with no conventional risk factors scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery and in healthy blood donors. Periodontal pathogens were isolated by aerobic and anaerobic culture. RESULTS: All patients except one were < yr of age and six were younger than yr. Seropositivity to C. pneumoniae was significantly higher in CAD patients than healthy controls ( vs. %, P<). Combined seropositivity to both C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae was significantly higher in CAD patients with myocardial infarction (MI) than those without MI ( vs. %, P<). Aerobic and anaerobic cultures for the isolation of periodontal pathogens were positive in seven patients and five healthy blood donors. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: C. pneumoniae seropositivity was significantly higher (P<) in CAD patients without any of the conventional risk factors for CAD. Combined seropositivity to C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae was significantly higher (P<) in CAD patients with MI than in those without MI.

However, there is no single study in which multiple infectious agents have been detected together in different vascular locations in the same population. This would help in determining if there is any leading pathogen in atheromatous plaques of CAD patients. Hence, we screened for C. pneumoniae, H. pylori, CMV and HSV- in different vascular locations of CAD patients using quantitative real-time (RT) PCR. We performed multiplex RT-PCR for detecting pathogens, viz. C. pneumoniae, H. pylori, CMV and HSV- in different vascular locations of CAD patients. Percent positivity scores for C. pneumoniae, H. pylori, CMV and HSV- in different vascular locations were as follows: aorta (, , and respectively); carotid (, , and respectively); coronary artery (, , and respectively). Combined positivity for C. pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae IgA and RT-PCR for C. pneumoniae) was the highest compared with all other groups. Aorta and coronary artery were more susceptible to these pathogens as compared with carotid artery. Moreover, CAD patients' characteristics were associated with C. pneumoniae positivity (C. pneumoniae IgA and RT-PCR), suggesting thereby that C. pneumoniae may have caused chronic persistent infection in CAD."", 'Infectious and coronary artery disease.. BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic event is one of the most causes of death in the world. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one manifestation of atherosclerosis. It is well-known that several risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking, hypertension (HTN), have effects on it. It is proposed that infection can lead to atherosclerosis or even make its process faster. Here, we discuss about the effect of some of infectious agents on the atherosclerosis and CAD. METHODS: In this study, first we did a comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct using some related keywords such as atherosclerosis, CAD, myocardial infarction (MI), infection, and name of viruses and bacteria. After finding the related papers, we reviewed the correlation between some microbial agents and risk of CAD. RESULTS: Literature has reported several infectious agents (viruses, bacteria, and parasites) that can be associated with risk of CAD. This association for some of them like Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), Chlamydia pneumonia (C. pneumoniae), and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a very strong. On the other hand, there are some other agents like influenza that still need to be more investigated through original studies. Furthermore, different mechanisms (general and special) have been reported for the association of each agent with CAD. CONCLUSION: Based on the studies in databases and our literature review, it is so clear that some microbes and infectious agents can be involved in the process of atherosclerosis. Therefore, controlling each type of infections especially among people with a traditional risk factor for atherosclerosis should be taken into account for reducing the risk of CAD and atherosclerosis.']",pneumoniae; atherosclerosis; chlamydia; coronary; atherosclerotic; cad; infectious; cytomegalovirus; artery; cmv,pneumoniae · atherosclerosis · chlamydia

OBJECTIVE: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori is an important treatment strategy in peptic ulcer patients. Current regimens of eradication consist of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotics. The principal enzyme involved in PPIs metabolism is CYP2C19, which exhibits an interindividual variability of activity, mainly due to genetic polymorphism. Two alleles (CYP2C19* and CYP2C19*), responsible for slow PPIs metabolism, were previously associated with higher efficacy of eradication. Recently, a novel CYP2C19 gene variant (CYP2C19*), associated with faster metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates, was described. In the present study, a potential association between CYP2C19* allele and lower H. pylori eradication efficacy was tested in a group of peptic ulcer patients. METHODS: A total of peptic ulcer patients, positive for H. pylori infection, were treated with triple therapy (pantoprazole+amoxicillin+metronidazole). Subsequently, the patients were divided into two groups (group - success, and group - failure of eradication after therapy) and genotyped for the presence of CYP2C19 variant alleles (*, *, and *). RESULTS: Frequency of CYP2C19 alleles in two groups of patients were: versus (p=) for *, versus (p=) for *, and versus (p=) for * allele, respectively. CYP2C19* was not detected in the evaluated population. No significant differences in frequency nor distribution of * allele were found between two groups of patients.

CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, contrary to CYP2C19*, CYP2C19* allele has no impact on efficacy of H. pylori eradication in peptic ulcer patients treated with pantoprazole.', 'Polymorphisms in the host CYP2C19 gene and antibiotic-resistance attributes of Helicobacter pylori isolates influence the outcome of triple therapy.. OBJECTIVES: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori is influenced by susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, elevated bacterial load and degree of acid inhibition, which can be affected by genotypes of drug-metabolizing enzymes [cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 polymorphism]. Theoretically, the choice and dose of proton pump inhibitor may also influence the suppression of H. pylori infection. The CYP2C19 genotype has recently been found to have an impact on peptic ulcer healing, H. pylori eradication and therapeutic efficacy of proton pump inhibitors. METHODS: Here, we investigated the impact of the CYP2C19 genotype polymorphism and the success of triple therapy (fluoroquinolones/metronidazole/clarithromycin) on antibiotic-resistant strains in eradicating H. pylori in human subjects with non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD), in human subjects with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and in asymptomatic human subjects (positive and negative for H. pylori infection). RESULTS: Based on the CYP2C19 genotypes, determined by Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) analysis, we found %, % and % corresponding to rapid metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers and poor metabolizers, respectively. However, we did not find any significant effect for homozygous ABCB1 or CYP2C19* and CYP2C19* alleles. We detected several participants heterozygous for both ABCB1 and CYP2C19*, CYP2C19* and CYP2C19* loci. The participants heterozygous for both ABCB1 and CYP2C19* and * loci should be defined as intermediate and poor metabolizers according to the haplotype analysis in the NUD, PUD and asymptomatic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, fluoroquinolones/metronidazole/clarithromycin-based triple therapies can be used to eradicate H. pylori infection, if one does not know the CYP2C19 genotype of the patient.', 'CYP2C19 polymorphism influences Helicobacter pylori eradication.. The known factors that have contributed to the decline of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication rate include antibiotic resistance, poor compliance, high gastric acidity, high bacterial load, and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) polymorphism. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is important in the eradication regimen. The principal enzyme implicated in the metabolism of PPIs is CYP2C19. The effects of PPI depend on metabolic enzyme, cytochrome P450 enzymes, and CYP2C19 with genetic differences in the activity of this enzyme (the homozygous EM, heterozygous EM (HetEM), and poor metabolizer). The frequency of the CYP2C19 polymorphism is highly varied among different ethnic populations. The CYP2C19 genotype is a cardinal factor of H. pylori eradication in patients taking omeprazole- based or lansoprazole-based triple therapies. In contrast, the CYP2C19 polymorphism has no significant effect on the rabeprazole-based or esomeprazole-based triple therapies. The efficacy of levofloxacin-based rescue triple therapy might be also affected by the CYP2C19 polymorphism, but CYP2C19 genotypes did not show obvious impact on other levofloxacin-based rescue therapies. Choice of different PPIs and/or increasing doses of PPIs should be individualized based on the pharmacogenetics background of each patient and pharmacological profile of each drug. Other possible factors influencing gastric acid secretion (e.g., IL-1β- polymorphism) would be also under consideration.']",cyp2c19; metabolizers; genotype; polymorphism; metabolizer; pm; eradication; rabeprazole; extensive; mdr1,cyp2c19 · metabolizers · genotype

BACKGROUND: Asthma, a serious health problem worldwide, is becoming more common. Colonization with Helicobacter pylori, a major human indigenous (commensal) microbe, during early life may be relevant to the risk of childhood asthma. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional analyses, using data from participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) -, to assess the association between H. pylori and childhood asthma. RESULTS: H. pylori seropositivity was inversely associated with onset of asthma before years of age and current asthma in children aged - years. Among participants - years of age, the presence of H. pylori was inversely related to ever having had asthma (odds ratio [OR], ; % confidence interval [CI], -), and the inverse association with onset of asthma before years of age was stronger (OR, ; % CI, -). Among participants - years of age, H. pylori positivity was significantly inversely associated with current asthma (OR, ; % CI, -). H. pylori seropositivity also was inversely related to recent wheezing, allergic rhinitis, and dermatitis, eczema, or rash. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report an inverse association between H. pylori seropositivity and asthma in children. The findings indicate new directions for research and asthma prevention.', 'The Protective Effects of Helicobacter pylori Infection on Allergic Asthma.. As an ancient Gram-negative bacterium, Helicobacter pylori has settled in human stomach. Eradicating H. pylori increases the morbidities of asthma and other allergic diseases. Therefore, H. pylori might play a protective role against asthma. The ""disappearing microbiota"" hypothesis suggests that the absence of certain types of the ancestral microbiota could change the development of immunology, metabolism, and cognitive ability in our early life, contributing to the development of some diseases. And the Hygiene Hypothesis links early environmental and microbial exposure to the prevalence of atopic allergies and asthma. Exposure to the environment and microbes can influence the growing immune system and protect subsequent immune-mediated diseases. H. pylori can inhibit allergic asthma by regulating the ratio of helper T cells / (Th1/Th2), Th17/regulatory T cells (Tregs), etc. H. pylori can also target dendritic cells to promote immune tolerance and enhance the protective effect on allergic asthma, and this effect relies on highly suppressed Tregs. The remote regulation of lung immune function by H. pylori is consistent with the gut-lung axis theory. Perhaps, H. pylori also protects against asthma by altering levels of stomach hormones, affecting the autonomic nervous system and lowering the expression of heat shock protein . Therapeutic products from H. pylori may be used to prevent and treat asthma. This paper reviews the possible protective influence of H. pylori on allergic asthma and the possible application of H. pylori in treating asthma.', 'Inverse Relationship Between Helicobacter Pylori Infection and Asthma Among Adults Younger than 40 Years: A Cross-Sectional Study.. Recent studies have suggested that Helicobacter pylori could prevent allergic disease, particularly in children. However, whether this is true in adults is controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is negative association between H. pylori infection and asthma among adults in an area with a high prevalence of H. pylori.This was a cross-sectional study using health surveillance data. Blood samples were taken from all participants to measure serum H. pylori IgG status. Information on demographics, socioeconomic status, and medical history, including asthma and other allergic conditions were collected by a questionnaire.Of the , patients, (%) had a history of H. pylori infection, (%) had asthma, and (%) had other allergic conditions. H. pylori infection was positively correlated with age (OR, ; % CI, -, P < ). Asthma history was positively correlated with age (OR, ; % CI, -, P < ). H. pylori and age were shown to have interaction on asthma in the total participants (OR, ; % CI, -, P < ). In subgroup analysis, H. pylori infection among those < years old was inversely correlated with asthma (OR, ; % CI, -, P = ).

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is a corpus-dominant atrophic gastritis in which patients are positive for antiparietal cell antibody (APCA) and/or anti-intrinsic factor antibody. The risk of developing gastric cancer in patients with AIG remains unclear, and reliable frequency data of AIG in patients with gastric cancer are lacking. METHODS: We included Korean patients with gastric tumors ( gastric cancers and neuroendocrine tumors) who had APCA results and were available for AIG evaluation. In patients with positive APCA results, endoscopy and histology findings were reviewed to diagnose AIG. RESULTS: Of the patients, (%) tested positive for APCA, and ultimately, (%) met the diagnostic criteria for AIG ( both endoscopy and histology findings, endoscopy-only findings, histology-only findings). The frequency of AIG in patients with gastric cancer was % (/), and that in patients with neuroendocrine tumors was % (/). Of the patients with AIG, serum Helicobacter pylori antibody was positive in six patients (%), all of whom had gastric cancer. Histologically, three patients showed pure AIG, four patients exhibited concurrent AIG and H. pylori gastritis, and the findings for four were indefinite for AIG. The pepsinogen (PG) I levels and PG I/II ratio were significantly lower in patients with gastric cancer with AIG than in patients with gastric cancer without AIG (p= and p=, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of AIG in gastric cancer patients was very low compared to that in patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Rather, concurrent AIG and H. pylori gastritis was common in patients with AIG with gastric cancer.', '[Analysis of the clinical characteristics of 59 cases of autoimmune gastritis].. Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with autoimmune gastritis (AIG) and compare the associated factors between AIG and type B atrophic gastritis. Methods: A total of patients were diagnosed as showing AIG at the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University between January and August . These patients were age-and sex-matched with patients diagnosed with type B atrophic gastritis at the same center. The basic information and relevant clinical indicators of the two groups of patients were recorded. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were used to determine the differential factors between AIG and type B atrophic gastritis. Results: AIG mainly occurred in patients aged - years and showed a sex ratio of approximately ∶. Anti-intrinsic factor antibody (IFA)-positive results were observed in % of patients showing AIG. The pepsinogen Ⅰand pepsinogen Ⅰ/Ⅱ ratio in the IFA-positive group was significantly lower than that in the IFA-negative group [ (,) vs. (, ) μg/L, t=-, P<; ± vs. ±, t=-, P<]. Among the patients with AIG, % had anemia, including % with severe anemia. The relevant indicators showed no statistically significant differences between patients with and without anemia. After univariate and multivariate logistic analyses, we compared gastric function and Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with AIG and type B atrophic gastritis, and the gastrin level was identified an independent differential factor between the two groups (OR=, %CI -, P=). Conclusion: The gastrin level can help distinguish AIG and type B atrophic gastritis, and is valuable for early identification of AIG. 目的： 分析自身免疫性胃炎（AIG）患者的基本临床特征，比较AIG与B型萎缩性胃炎相关因素差异。 方法： 收集2021年1月至2024年8月于中国医科大学附属第一医院明确诊断为AIG的患者59例，根据性别、年龄，于本中心匹配B型萎缩性胃炎患者59例，记录患者的基本信息和临床相关指标。将AIG患者与B型萎缩性胃炎患者各项指标进行单因素及多因素logistic分析，确定差异因素。 结果： AIG主要集中于50~70岁，男女性别比约为1∶。%患者存在抗内因子抗体阳性，抗内因子抗体阳性组的胃蛋白酶原Ⅰ［（，）μg/L］、胃蛋白酶原Ⅰ/Ⅱ比值（±）显著低于抗内因子抗体阴性组胃蛋白酶原Ⅰ［（，）μg/L］、胃蛋白酶原Ⅰ/Ⅱ比值（±）（均P<，t值分别为-、-）。%患者伴有贫血，其中：重度贫血占1.%，贫血组和非贫血组相关指标差异无统计学意义。经单因素及多因素logistic分析，比较了AIG与B型萎缩性胃炎患者胃功能和幽门螺杆菌结果，胃泌素17水平与两组差异独立相关（OR=，%CI ~，P=）。 结论： 胃泌素17水平有助于鉴别AIG和B型萎缩型胃炎，对早期识别AIG有一定价值。.', 'Endoscopic features and clinical importance of autoimmune gastritis.. Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is a special type of chronic gastritis characterized by autoimmune disorders caused by cellular immunity, resulting in the destruction of parietal cells and production of antiparietal cell antibodies. Endoscopic findings of AIG are mainly characterized by corpus-dominant advanced atrophy. The antral area is generally considered to have no or mild atrophy; however, there are cases wherein the gastric mucosa is red or faded due to past infection with Helicobacter pylori or bile reflux. Currently, there are no diagnostic criteria for AIG in Japan, and it is important to make a diagnosis based on the presence of gastric autoantibodies and characteristic endoscopic and histological findings. AIG is associated with gastric cancer, neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and other autoimmune diseases, such as thyroid diseases, anemia, and neurological symptoms due to impaired absorption of iron and vitamin B12 , and thus requires systemic treatment. The significance of diagnosing AIG is to include patients as a high-risk group for the development of gastric cancer and gastric NETs, provide an opportunity to detect autoimmune endocrine diseases, and initiate therapeutic intervention before anemia and neurological symptoms develop. It is important to pay close attention to the occurrence of AIG comorbidities not only at the time of AIG diagnosis but also during follow-up after detection.']",aig; autoimmune; gastritis; atrophic; parietal; atrophy; aag; neuroendocrine; patients; anemia,aig · autoimmune · gastritis

BACKGROUND: Analysis of serum biomarkers for the assessment of atrophic gastritis (AG), considered as gastric precancerous lesion, is of growing interest and recommended by current guidelines. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a panel of biomarkers (GastroPanel®) for the detection of AG in France, a country of a low gastric cancer (GC) incidence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study, consecutive patients considered at increased risk of GC and undergoing upper endoscopy with gastric biopsies were included. Blood samples were collected for the analysis of GastroPanel® (association of Pepsinogens I and II, Gastrin-, and Helicobacter pylori serology) using ELISA. The results of GastroPanel® were compared to the results of histology considered as the reference. RESULTS: Between and , patients ( cases with AG, controls without AG) were included. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values for the detection of AG by GastroPanel® were of % (% CI ; ), % (% CI ; ), (% CI ; ), and (% CI ; ), respectively. The sensitivity was significantly higher for the detection of severe AG [% (% CI ; ) P = .] and corpus AG [% (% CI ; ), P = .]. Diagnostic performances of GastroPanel® tended to be better than those of Pepsinogen I alone, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = .).

BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that GastroPanel might be a useful tool for the diagnosis of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) measuring four biomarkers in blood: basal gastrin- (G17), pepsinogen I and II (PGI and PGII), and Helicobacter pylori antibodies. AIM: To determine the accuracy of GastroPanel for the diagnosis of CAG. METHODS: This was a prospective, blinded, multicenter study that included dyspeptic patients. G17, PGI, and PGII were determined by enzyme immunoassays. Three antrum and two corpus biopsies were obtained for standard histological analysis and rapid urease test. Biopsies were analyzed by a single blinded expert pathologist. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were included (% women, mean age years, % H. pylori positive, % with CAG). G17 was reduced in patients with antrum CAG ( vs. pmol/l; P<) and increased in patients with corpus CAG ( vs. pmol/l; P<), but its accuracy was only acceptable in the case of corpus localization [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), %]; PGII difference was almost statistically significant only when testing for corpus atrophy ( vs. μg/l; P=; AUC=%). The PGI and PGI/PGII ratio showed no significant differences (AUCs were all unacceptably low). Helicobacter pylori antibody levels were higher in H. pylori-infected patients ( vs. EIU, P=; AUC=). The accuracy of GastroPanel for the diagnosis of CAG was as follows: sensitivity %; specificity %; positive % and negative % predictive values; and positive and negative likelihood ratios. CONCLUSION: GastroPanel is not accurate enough for the diagnosis of CAG; thus, its systematic use in clinical practice cannot be recommended.', 'Prevalence of atrophic gastritis in dyspeptic patients in Piedmont. A survey using the GastroPanel test.. BACKGROUND: Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is a precursor of the intestinal type of gastric cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. GastroPanel is a recently marketed serological kit for the non-invasive diagnosis of CAG, defined by some authors ""even more reliable than biopsy histology"". The goal of this study was ) to evaluate the agreement between the serum gastric profile provided by GastroPanel (PGI, PGII, G-, AbHp) and histology over CAG diagnosis, and ) to evaluate the prevalence of CAG by means of GastroPanel in a Northern Italian dyspeptic population. METHODS: Basal blood samples for GastroPanel parameters evaluation (Biohit Plc, Finland) were collected after an overnight fast from dyspeptic patients (age range: - years; F ). Gastroscopy with two biopsies each of the antrum and corpus was offered to a group of the first consecutive patients (age - years, F ) to compare the results of histology and GastroPanel in CAG. RESULTS: Agreement between GastroPanel and histology for corpus-prevalent CAG was %, with a sensitivity and specificity of % and %, respectively. In our series of dyspeptic patients, the prevalence of corpus-prevalent CAG, of antral-prevalent CAG and of multifocal CAG (antrum+ corpus) was %, % and %, respectively. Out of the patients with multifocal atrophic gastritis, % were under years of age.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of patients with gastric cancer were interviewed, clinicopathological information was retrieved, and in situ hybridization was performed for EBV-encoded small RNAs. RESULTS: There were EBV-GC (male:female=:) and non-EBV-GC patients (male:female=:). A history of previous gastric ulcer was associated with EBV-GC, whereas frequent and heavy alcohol drinking was related to non-EBV-GC. Additionally, skipping breakfast was correlated with EBV-GC in male patients. Other factors, such as body mass index, history of gastritis, Helicobacter pylori infection, ABO blood type, family history of gastric cancer, education level, marital status, occupation, family status, and dietary factors, showed no significant differences between EBV-GC and non-EBV-GC. CONCLUSION: A history of gastric ulcer, reflecting chemical injury to the stomach mucosa, appears to contribute to development of EBV-GC.

Background: Helicobacter pylori (HP) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) coinfection lead to chronic inflammation and contribute to the development of gastric cancer. However, studies examining the association between HP virulence factors and EBV infection in gastric cancer are limited. This study investigated the polymorphisms of HP virulence factors associated with EBV infection and their effects on clinical outcomes in EBV-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC). Methods: A total of HP isolates from patients with gastric cancer were divided and analyzed based on EBV coinfection status. Polymerase chain reaction amplifications of virulence factors were conducted using DNA extracts from HP isolates cultured from gastric mucosal specimens. Results: EBV infection was significantly associated with gastric carcinoma with lymphoid stroma morphology and a proximal location in the stomach. Most HP strains from patients with gastric cancer were positive for cagA (%), vacA (%), and iceA1 (%). Among HP isolates with EBV coinfection, the prevalence of iceA2 (% vs. %, p < ) and ureA (% vs. %, p = ) was significantly more frequent, and that of iceA1 (% vs. %, p = ) and vacA s1a (% vs. %, p = ) was less frequent than those of EBV- colonies. Multivariate analysis indicated that ureA (odds ratio, ; % confidence interval [CI], to ; p = ) was associated with EBVaGC. No significant difference in clinical outcomes was observed based on the presence of ureA expression in EBVaGC. Conclusions: In gastric cancer, regardless of EBV infection, most HP strains were highly virulent, testing positive for cagA, vacA, and iceA1. Although ureA was significantly associated with EBV infection, it did not influence the clinical outcomes of EBVaGC.', 'Epstein-Barr virus infection in patients with chronic gastritis without Helicobacter pylori infection.. BACKGROUND/AIMS: The association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with gastric malignancies has been proven by many studies in the literature. However, information about EBV-associated inflammation/gastritis remains limited. The aim of this study is to establish the prevalence of latent EBV infection in patients with chronic gastritis without H. pylori infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, patients with gastritis without H. pylori infection were included. Furthermore, patients with H. pylori gastritis were included in the study as a control group. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (EBV-encoded RNA) and immunohistochemistry (LMP- antibody) were performed in all cases. The prevalence of EBV and its relationship with age, sex, the affected part of the stomach, the density of inflammation, inflammatory activity, intestinal metaplasia, and atrophy were analyzed. RESULTS: In this study, cases showed positive immunostaining for EBV. EBV positivity was seen mostly in the lymphoid tissue ( cases), but it was also detected at the gastric epithelium ( cases). The mean age of the patients was years, which was slightly younger than that of the EBV-negative cases ( years). The inflammation density was higher in EBV-positive cases than the EBV-negative gastritis cases (p=). Intestinal metaplasia was detected in % of the cases. EBV-positive cases had a higher incidence of atrophy without intestinal metaplasia (% vs % without EBV). CONCLUSION: EBV was detected in % of the cases with gastritis without H. pylori infection. Endoscopic follow-up may be appropriate for patients with gastritis, who have atrophy without intestinal metaplasia and are H. pylori negative but EBV positive.']",ebv; epsteinbarr; virus; ebvagc; coinfection; gc; ebvassociated; gastric; cancer; ebvpositive,ebv · epsteinbarr · virus

Our hypothesis was that H. pylori infection might negatively influence pregnancy development and outcome. A total of consecutive pregnant women were recruited before weeks' gestation, from October to August , and blood samples were collected from each subject. IgG antibodies against H. pylori were assayed in maternal serum by a commercial immunoassay. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess any association between H. pylori seropositivity and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was the most common maternal complication (%) and the only pregnancy-related disorder with a significantly higher rate of H. pylori-positive women (%) compared with subjects who did not develop the disease (%; P < ; OR = , % CI = -). The difference observed remained statistically significant after adjusting for potential confounding variables.

BACKGROUND: The effects of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection on metabolic syndrome (MetS) in pregnant women are unclear to date. This study was designed to explore the relationship between H. pylori infection and MetS during pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnant women were enrolled in the prospective cohort study, and their demographic data and metabolic parameters were collected. H. pylori infection was measured using the C13 urea breath test. All enrolled patients were followed up until the last baby was born. Metabolic disorders, including elevated levels of serum triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and blood glucose (BG), and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preeclampsia, spontaneous preterm birth (SPB), fetal growth restriction (FGR), and uncomplicated pregnancy, were recorded during follow up. RESULTS: There were pregnant women enrolled in this study. They were divided into two groups according to H. pylori infection, and each group was then divided into two subgroups on whether their BMI was more than or not. The results showed that H. pylori infection significantly increased the incidence of MetS as well as other metabolic disorders, especially in pregnant women with high BMI. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that risk factors of MetS were high BMI and H. pylori infection. Besides, H. pylori infection increased the incidence of GDM and preeclampsia and potentially reduced the incidence of uncomplicated pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection in pregnant women acts as a crucial risk factor of Mets and affects the incidence of several adverse pregnancy outcomes.', 'The association of Helicobacter pylori with adverse pregnancy outcomes in three European birth cohorts.. BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori is a prevalent infection that may complicate pregnancy, but evidence remains limited, controversial and may not apply to all pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate whether Helicobacter pylori is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes and to identify vulnerable subpopulations. STUDY DESIGN: Multiplex serology was utilized to measure blood levels of immunoglobulin G against eight Helicobacter pylori antigens in pregnant women from three European birth cohorts: BiB (United Kingdom), Rhea (Greece) and INMA (Spain). Outcomes of interest included gestational diabetes mellitus, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, preterm birth and small for gestational age neonates, as well as prenatal anxiety and depression. Adjusted logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between Helicobacter pylori seropositivity (overall and by antigen) and antigen specific antibody levels with the outcomes. We examined effect modification of the associations by ethnicity. RESULTS: Helicobacter pylori seropositivity was detected in % (/) of pregnant women. Preeclampsia was the least common outcome (/).

Women with high antibody levels to Helicobacter pylori antigens GroEL and NapA were more likely to develop preeclampsia [OR: (% CI: -), p-value: ; OR: (% CI: -), p-value )]. Helicobacter pylori seropositivity increased the odds of developing any hypertensive disorder during pregnancy among women of western ethnicity (/) [OR: (% CI: -), p-value ]. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that Helicobacter pylori seropositivity is a risk factor for multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes and particularly in women of western origin for hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: The association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is controversial. We conducted a retrospective study to clarify the seroprevalence of H. pylori infection and the relationship between NAFLD and H. pylori infection in north urban Chinese. METHODS: The retrospective study was performed at Aerospace Center Hospital in Beijing. All subjects in this study were a healthy population who underwent health examinations at the hospital between and . A logistic regression model was used to calculate the association between NAFLD and H. pylori infection. Age, gender, underlying diseases, and metabolic syndrome (MS) were adjusted. Effects of NAFLD on H. pylori infection in a different age, gender, and number of MS characteristic subgroups were analyzed. RESULTS: There were (%) subjects with H. pylori infection, (%) with mild NAFLD, (%) with moderate NAFLD, and (%) with severe NAFLD among subjects. H. pylori infection was related to the seroprevalence of any level of NAFLD, including mild, moderate, and severe NAFLD (OR = , % CI: -; OR = , % CI: -; and OR = , % CI: -, respectively). The results of subgroup analysis showed that the risk of incident NAFLD from H. pylori infection had significant interactions by subjects with or without MS characteristics.

Because treatment for NAFLD, other than weight loss is limited, the treatment for H. pylori infection is well established. It is important to determine whether screening and treatment for H. pylori infection should be considered in patients with no gastrointestinal symptoms.

Fatty liver was diagnosed by ultrasonography. RESULTS: During the , person-years follow-up, participants with H. pylori infection had a higher rate of incident NAFLD than those who were uninfected. In a multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol intake, regular exercise, year of screening exam, and education level, the hazard ratio (HR) for NAFLD development in participants with H. pylori infection compared to those without infection was [% confidence interval (CI), -]. The association persisted after further adjustment for metabolic variables, inflammatory marker, and liver enzymes. The association between H. pylori and NAFLD was still evident in an analysis using fatty liver index as a surrogate marker of NAFLD. In addition, the association between H. pylori infection and incident NAFLD did not differ across clinically relevant subgroups evaluated.

In the developed Western countries, despite the accumulation of knowledge about the causes and treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding, as well as the experience of gastroenterologists-endoscopists using sophisticated endoscopic devices, the number of hospitalizations and mortality rates has not declined as expected. The most likely explanations are the following: aging population, increased prevalence of alcoholic liver cirrhosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease and obesity, Helicobacter pylori antibiotic resistance, using dual anti-aggregation therapy, anticoagulants, and excessive use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The aim of this paper is to show the incidence and the most common signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding. The aim is also to present initial clinical evaluation, diagnostic methods, the main causes of gastrointestinal bleeding, endoscopic hemostatic modalities and treatment of bleeding from the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Using the MEDLINE and Ovid databases, we searched the meta-analyses and systematic reviews published in English during the - period. Meta-analyses included results of randomized, double-blind studies on adults treated for gastrointestinal bleeding. Included were guidelines of the European and American Society of Gastroenterological Endoscopy, as well as recent expert work. In this review, we bring the state-of-the-art on gastrointestinal bleeding, new classification of gastrointestinal bleeding from the upper, mid and lower gut, controversy of nasogastric tube placement, use of prokinetic agents and inhibitor proton pumps in acute gastrointestinal bleeding from the upper tract, restrictive transfusion strategy, useful clinical stratification of the severity of bleeding, indications for hospitalization and outcome of using the clinical bleeding score, proper use of gastroprotection in patients at a high risk of peptic ulcer, the need of initial endoscopy, variceal assessment in newly diagnosed liver cirrhosis, primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, new endoscopic hemostatic modality, and radiological and surgical treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding. The educational nature of this review could serve for establishing Croatian guideline for the management of gastrointestinal bleeding.', 'Guidelines for endoscopic management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (second edition).. The Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society has prepared Guidelines for Endoscopic Practice in Nonvariceal Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding as part of the initiative to develop evidence-based endoscopic practice guidelines. Hemorrhagic gastroduodenal (peptic) ulcers are the primary cause of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. With the advent of a super-aged society, the cases caused by Helicobacter pylori are on the decline, whereas those caused by drugs (e.g. aspirin) have been increasing. Endoscopic hemostasis is currently the first-line treatment for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and various methods have been devised for this purpose. It is recommended to stabilize the vital signs of the patient before and after endoscopic hemostasis with appropriate management based on an assessment of the severity of illness, in addition to the administration of acid secretion inhibitors. These guidelines describe the evaluation and initial treatment of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as well as the selection of endoscopic hemostasis for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding and its management after endoscopic hemostasis. This is achieved by classifying nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding into two main categories, namely, peptic ulcer and other types of gastrointestinal bleeding. We prepared statements for any available literature with supporting evidence, including the levels of evidence and recommendations. New evidence has been pooled since the publication of the first edition in this area; however, the levels of evidence and recommendations mostly remain low.', 'Epidemiology of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.. Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is an important emergency situation. Population-based epidemiology data are important to get insight in the actual healthcare problem. There are only few recent epidemiological surveys regarding acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Several surveys focusing on peptic ulcer disease showed a significant decrease in admission and mortality of peptic ulcer disease. Several more recent epidemiological surveys show a decrease in incidence of all cause upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The incidence of peptic ulcer bleeding remained stable. Peptic ulcer bleeding is the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, responsible for about % of all cases, followed by oesophagitis and erosive disease. Variceal bleeding is the cause of bleeding in cirrhotic patients in -%. Rebleeding in upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs in -%, despite endoscopic therapy. Rebleeding is especially high in variceal bleeding and peptic ulcer bleeding. Mortality ranges between and % and did not change in the past years. Mortality is increasing with increasing age and is significantly higher in patients who are already admitted in hospital for co-morbidity. Risk factors for peptic ulcer bleeding are NSAIDs use and H. pylori infection. In patients at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and using NSAIDs, a protective drug was only used in %. COX- selective inhibitors do cause less gastroduodenal ulcers compared to non-selective NSAIDs, however, more cardiovascular adverse events are reported. H. pylori infection is found in about % of peptic ulcer bleeding patients. H. pylori should be tested for in all ulcer patients and eradication should be given.']",bleeding; ugib; upper; nonvariceal; gastrointestinal; gib; mortality; management; rebleeding; acute,bleeding · ugib · upper

CONCLUSION: Up to one-quarter of cancer cases and deaths would be preventable through appropriate control of infectious agents in Korea.', 'Burden of cancer attributable to infection in Japan in 2015.. Population attributable fraction (PAF) offers a means to quantify cancer burden that is attributable to a specific etiological factor. To better characterize the current cancer burden due to infection in the Japanese population, we estimated the PAF for cancer incidence and mortality in that could be attributable to infectious agents, including Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), Hepatitis B and C (HBV/HCV), Human papillomavirus virus (HPV), Epstein- Barr virus, and human T-lymphotropic virus type . We estimated the PAFs for each infectious agent on the basis of representative data on prevalence and risk-outcome associations assuming a latency period of years. Overall, % of cancer cases in in Japan were attributable to the infectious agents included in this analysis. The estimated PAF was slightly higher in men (%) than in women (%). The highest proportion of cancer deaths attributable to infectious agents was observed for H. pylori infection, followed by HBV/HCV, and HPV infection. Our findings corroborated with previous estimates that H. pylori and HBV/HCV infections were the two most important infectious agents in the Japanese population. Strategies focusing on eradication of infectious agents among infected individuals or primary prevention through vaccination could decrease the burden of infection-related cancers.']",cancers; virus; attributable; agents; cancer; hepatitis; infectious; see; infections; hpv,cancers · virus · attributable

OBJECTIVES: There are contradictory reports on the relationship between Helicobacter pylori and circulating ghrelin. We sought to clarify the influence of H. pylori infection on gastric and plasma ghrelin dynamics in humans. METHODS: Using endoscopic biopsies from the corpus of H. pylori-infected patients and uninfected subjects, ghrelin mRNA expression levels and gastric ghrelin peptide contents were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and radioimmunoassay, respectively. We also measured plasma ghrelin concentrations and analyzed the numbers of ghrelin immunoreactive cells in the fundic gland area. Fifty-one patients with H. pylori infection were treated with a -day triple therapy consisting of lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. RESULTS: The gastric ghrelin mRNA expression level of H. pylori-positive patients ( +/- in arbitrary units) was significantly lower than in H. pylori-negative subjects ( +/- , p < ). A similar trend was noted for ghrelin peptide contents ( +/- vs +/- ng/mg protein, respectively, p < ). There was no significant difference in the number of ghrelin immunoreactive cells/mm() in terms of H. plyori status. Plasma ghrelin concentrations in H. pylori-infected patients ( +/- . fmol/ml) were significantly lower than in uninfected subjects ( +/- , p < ) and increased following cure of the infection. Plasma ghrelin levels correlated positively with the expression levels of ghrelin mRNA (r = , p < ) and peptide products (r = , p < ). There was a significant stepwise decrease in gastric ghrelin mRNA expression (p < ), peptide contents (p < ) and density of ghrelin immunoreactive cells (p < ) with progression of histological severity of glandular atrophy in the corpus. The histological severity of chronic inflammation also negatively influenced the ghrelin mRNA expression (p < ) and peptide production (p < ). CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection has a negative impact on gastric and plasma ghrelin dynamics. Chronic inflammatory and atrophic changes associated with the infection may affect gastric ghrelin biosynthesis and contribute to the low circulating levels.', 'Changes in plasma ghrelin levels, gastric ghrelin production, and body weight after Helicobacter pylori cure.. BACKGROUND: Ghrelin is a body weight-regulating peptide produced and secreted primarily by the gastric mucosa. Helicobacter pylori infection impairs gastric ghrelin production, leading to a lower plasma ghrelin concentration. However, the effect of H. pylori eradication on plasma ghrelin levels and its relation to body weight change after H. pylori cure are still uncertain. We examined the association of plasma ghrelin levels with gastric ghrelin production and body weight change before and after H. pylori eradication. METHODS: Plasma ghrelin concentrations, gastric ghrelin expression, and body weight were determined in a total of consecutive individuals before and weeks after successful H. pylori eradication. Gastric ghrelin expression was evaluated by determining mRNA expression levels and the number of ghrelin-producing cells in gastric mucosa biopsy specimens by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: Plasma ghrelin concentration increased in patients and decreased in patients after H. pylori eradication. After H. pylori cure, however, gastric preproghrelin mRNA expression was increased nearly fourfold (P < ), and the number of ghrelin-positive cells was increased or unchanged. In contrast, plasma ghrelin changes after H. pylori cure were inversely correlated with both body weight change (P < ) and initial plasma ghrelin levels (P < ). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in plasma ghrelin concentrations before and after H. pylori cure were inversely correlated with body weight change and initial plasma ghrelin levels but not with gastric ghrelin production in Japanese patients.', 'Ghrelin and Helicobacter pylori infection.. Ghrelin is primarily secreted from the stomach and has been implicated in the coordination of eating behavior and weight regulation. Ghrelin also plays an essential role in the mechanism of gastric mucosal defense. Thus, it is important to clarify which diseases primarily influence changes in plasma ghrelin concentrations. Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection is involved in the pathogenesis of gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer, gastric carcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. H pylori eradication is related to body weight change. Compared, H pylori infected and negative subjects with normal body mass index, plasma ghrelin concentration, gastric ghrelin mRNA, and the number of ghrelin producing cells in gastric mucosa are significantly lower in H pylori infected subjects than in H pylori-negative controls. Plasma ghrelin concentration decreases with the progression of gastric atrophy. Impaired gastric ghrelin production in association with atrophic gastritis induced by H pylori infection accounts for the decrease in plasma ghrelin concentration. However, the ratio of plasma acylated ghrelin to total ghrelin levels is higher in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis than in healthy subjects. This may result from the compensatory increase in plasma active ghrelin concentration in response to gastric atrophy. After H pylori eradication, gastric preproghrelin mRNA expression is increased nearly -fold in most cases. However, changes in plasma ghrelin concentrations before and after H pylori cure are not associated with the gastric ghrelin production. Plasma ghrelin changes are inversely correlated with both body weight change and initial plasma ghrelin levels.']",ghrelin; leptin; plasma; levels; obestatin; serum; pgml; circulating; body; acylated,ghrelin · leptin · plasma

Established risk factors for pancreatic cancer, including tobacco smoking, chronic pancreatitis, obesity and type diabetes, collectively account for less than half of all pancreatic cancer cases. Inflammation plays a key role in pancreatic carcinogenesis, but it is unclear what causes local inflammation, other than pancreatitis. Epidemiological data suggest that Helicobacter pylori may be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, and more recently, data suggest that periodontal disease, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, a pathogen for periodontal disease, may also play a role in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Individuals with periodontal disease have elevated markers of systemic inflammation, and oral bacteria can disseminate into the blood, stomach, heart and even reach the brain. These infections may contribute to the progression of pancreatic cancer by acting jointly with other pancreatic cancer risk factors that impact the inflammation and immune response, such as smoking and obesity, and the ABO genetic variant, recently linked to pancreatic cancer through genome-wide association studies. The complex interplay between bacteria, host immune response and environmental factors has been examined closely in relation to gastric cancer, but new research suggests bacteria may be playing a role in other gastrointestinal cancers. This review will summarize the literature on epidemiological studies examining infections that have been linked to pancreatic cancer and propose mechanistic pathways that may tie infections to pancreatic cancer.', 'Pathogenic Microorganisms and Pancreatic Cancer.. BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. No effective screening methods exist, and available treatment modalities do not effectively treat the disease. Established risk factors for pancreatic cancer, including smoking, chronic pancreatitis, obesity and type diabetes mellitus, collectively account for less than half of all pancreatic cancer cases. Accumulating reports have demonstrated that there is an association between pathogenic microorganisms and pancreatic cancer. SUMMARY: A substantial amount of preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that microbiota are likely to influence pancreatic carcinogenesis. This review summarizes the literature on studies examining infections that have been linked to pancreatic cancer. KEY MESSAGE: Helicobacter pylori infection may be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer; chronic hepatitis virus and oral microbiota may also play a role in pancreatic carcinogenesis. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Considering the worldwide burden of the disease, the association between microbiota and pancreatic cancer in this review may provide new ideas to prevent and treat pancreatic cancer more efficiently. Further studies in this direction are urgently needed.', 'Epidemiology of pancreatic cancer: an update.. Pancreatic cancer, although infrequent, has a very poor prognosis, making it one of the or most common causes of cancer mortality in developed countries. Its incidence varies greatly across regions, which suggests that lifestyle factors such as diet, and environmental factors, such as vitamin D exposure, play a role. Because pancreatic cancer is strongly age-dependent, increasing population longevity and ageing will lead to an increase of the global burden of pancreatic cancer in the coming decades. Smoking is the most common known risk factor, causing -% of all pancreatic tumors. Although a common cause of pancreatitis, heavy alcohol intake is associated only with a modest increased risk of pancreatic cancer. While viruses do not represent a major risk factor, people infected with Helicobacter pylori appeared to be at high risk of pancreatic cancer. Many factors associated with the metabolic syndrome, including overweight and obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and long-standing diabetes also increase the risk disease, while atopic allergy and use of metformin as a treatment for diabetes have been associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer. A family history of pancreatic cancer is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer and it is estimated that -% of patients with pancreatic cancer have an underlying germline disorder. Having a non-O blood group, another inherited characteristic, has also been steadily associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. While many risk factors for pancreatic cancer are not modifiable, adopting a healthy lifestyle could substantially reduce pancreatic cancer risk.']",pancreatic; pancreatitis; cancer; risk; pc; aip; association; studies; autoimmune; pancreas,pancreatic · pancreatitis · cancer

Many Gram-negative pathogens harbor type IV secretion systems (T4SS) that translocate bacterial virulence factors into host cells to hijack cellular processes. The pathology of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori strongly depends on a T4SS encoded by the cag pathogenicity island. This T4SS forms a needle-like pilus, and its assembly is accomplished by multiple protein-protein interactions and various pilus-associated factors that bind to integrins followed by delivery of the CagA oncoprotein into gastric epithelial cells. Recent studies revealed the crystal structures of six T4SS proteins and pilus formation is modulated by iron and zinc availability. All these T4SS interactions are crucial for deregulating host signaling events and disease progression. New developments in T4SS functions and their importance for pathogenesis are discussed.', 'The Helicobacter pylori Type IV Secretion System Encoded by the cag Pathogenicity Island: Architecture, Function, and Signaling.. Various gram-negative pathogens express type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) which translocate bacterial virulence factors into host target cells to hijack cellular processes for their own benefit and causing disease. The pathology of Helicobacter pylori, the causative agent of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer in humans, strongly depends on a T4SS encoded by the cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI). This T4SS represents a pilus-like structure and a membrane-spanning complex. T4SS assembly is achieved by various protein-protein interactions and several pilus-associated components (CagL, CagI, CagY, and CagA) that allow docking to the host cell integrin member α5β1 followed by delivery of its major effector protein, CagA, across the host cell membrane. In addition, recent studies have shown that H. pylori exploits human CEACAM receptors via the adhesin HopQ, encoded outside of the cagPAI, for bacterial adherence and translocation of CagA. Here, we review the composition and assembly of the H. pylori T4SS and its fundamental role in the infection process. We discuss major CagA-dependent and CagA-independent signaling events by the T4SS in vitro and in animal models in vivo, which include the induction of cytoskeletal rearrangements, membrane dynamics, disturbance of cell polarity as well as transcriptional responses involved in inflammation, cell proliferation, and anti-apoptosis.

Aberrant methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions can permanently inactivate tumor-suppressor genes, as mutations and chromosomal abnormalities do. In gastric cancers, CDKN2A, CDH1, and MLH1 are inactivated more frequently by aberrant methylation than by mutations, and novel tumor-suppressor genes inactivated by promoter methylation are being identified. We recently found that Helicobacter pylori (HP), a potent gastric carcinogen, induces aberrant methylation in gastric mucosae. When a panel of CpG islands was examined, some CpG islands were consistently methylated in gastric mucosae of individuals with HP infection, while others were resistant. The amount of methylated DNA molecules in the gastric mucosae (methylation level) fluctuated while active HP infection was present, but decreased after it was no longer present. Among individuals without active HP infection, methylation levels in the gastric mucosae were higher in individuals with gastric cancers than in those without. DNA methylation is emerging as a promising marker for past exposure to carcinogens and future risk of cancers.', 'DNA methylation as a molecular biomarker in gastric cancer.. DNA methylation plays a significant role in gastric carcinogenesis. The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) characterizes distinct subtypes of gastric cancer (GC) and the relationship between specific methylation patterns and clinicopathological features has been evaluated. Altered DNA methylation is also observed in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric mucosa, and its potential utility for GC risk estimation has been suggested. The ability to detect small amounts of methylated DNA among tissues allows us to use DNA methylation as a molecular biomarker in GC in a variety of samples, including serum, plasma and gastric washes. The DNA methylation status of nontargeted tissue, particularly blood, has been associated with predisposition to GC. We focus on the recent development of DNA methylation-based biomarkers in GC.', 'Risk prediction of gastric cancer by analysis of aberrant DNA methylation in non-neoplastic gastric epithelium.. BACKGROUND: Aberrant DNA methylation is one of the major events in carcinogenesis. Promoter DNA methylation is also present in various non-neoplastic tissues including gastric epithelium as age-related phenomenon, suggesting that it occurs early in the process of tumorigenesis. AIM: We aimed to clarify the relationship of aberrant DNA methylation in non-neoplastic gastric epithelia with the risk of gastric cancer, Helicobactor pylori infection, and the degree of H. pylori-induced gastritis. METHODS: patients enrolled in this study. The status of aberrant DNA methylation was compared in two groups of patients: cases with gastric cancer (mean age years [-], F:M = , intestinal type [n = ], diffuse type [n = ]) and age- and sex-matched patients without gastric cancer (peptic ulcer diseases [n = ], gastritis [n = ]) as a control group. Genomic DNA was extracted directly from non-neoplastic epithelia of antral biopsies obtained by endoscopy. The promoter methylation status of the p14 and p21 genes was determined by methylation-specific-polymerase chain reaction (MSP). The promoter methylation status of the p16 gene was quantified by digital densitographic analysis following MSP. The degree of gastritis in the antrum was assessed according to the updated Sydney system. The PG I/II ratio was calculated based on the data of serum PG I and PG II levels measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: In all subjects, CpG island methylation was found in % for p14, % for p16, % for p21. Among non-cancer patients, the methylation frequency of the p14 gene was significantly higher in H. pylori-positive than in H. pylori-negative patients ( vs. %, p = ). The mean (+/- SD) methylation levels of the p16 gene in non-neoplastic gastric epithelium was significantly higher in gastric cancer cases both in all patients and in H. pylori-positive patients ( +/- vs. +/- ; p = , +/- vs. +/- ; p = , respectively). The methylation level of the p16 gene was also associated with the presence of intestinal-type gastric cancer (p = ). The methylation level of the p16 gene was significantly higher in patients with intestinal metaplasia (IM) than those without (p = ). Furthermore, the methylation level of the p16 gene was correlated with lower PG l/ll ratio (p = ). The methylation of the p21gene was found in only patient with gastric cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that promoter of the p14 gene may be one of the specific regions whose methylation is closely associated with H. pylori infection. Methylation levels of the p16 gene seem to be accumulated in the progression of gastric mucosal atrophy and IM, and thus may be associated with the presence of gastric cancer especially for intestinal-type histopathology.']",methylation; promoter; dna; cpg; runx3; aberrant; gc; cancer; genes; cihm,methylation · promoter · dna

Gastric acid secretion (i) facilitates digestion of protein as well as absorption of micronutrients and certain medications, (ii) kills ingested microorganisms, including Helicobacter pylori, and (iii) prevents bacterial overgrowth and enteric infection. The principal regulators of acid secretion are the gastric peptides gastrin and somatostatin. Gastrin, the major hormonal stimulant for acid secretion, is synthesized in pyloric mucosal G cells as a -amino acid precursor (preprogastrin) that is processed to yield biologically active amidated gastrin- and gastrin-. The C-terminal active site of gastrin (Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2 ) binds to gastrin/CCK2 receptors on parietal and, more importantly, histamine-containing enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, located in oxyntic mucosa, to induce acid secretion. Histamine diffuses to the neighboring parietal cells where it binds to histamine H2 -receptors coupled to hydrochloric acid secretion. Gastrin is also a trophic hormone that maintains the integrity of gastric mucosa, induces proliferation of parietal and ECL cells, and is thought to play a role in carcinogenesis. Somatostatin, present in D cells of the gastric pyloric and oxyntic mucosa, is the main inhibitor of acid secretion, particularly during the interdigestive period. Somatostatin exerts a tonic paracrine restraint on gastrin secretion from G cells, histamine secretion from ECL cells, and acid secretion from parietal cells. Removal of this restraint, for example by activation of cholinergic neurons during ingestion of food, initiates and maximizes acid secretion.

RECENT FINDINGS: Parietal cells, distributed along much of the length of the oxyntic glands, with highest density in the neck and base, secrete HCl as well as transforming growth factor-alpha, amphiregulin, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, and sonic hedgehog.

The major stimulants of acid secretion are gastrin, histamine, and acetylcholine. Ghrelin and orexin also stimulate acid secretion. The main inhibitor of acid secretion is somatostatin. Nitric oxide and dopamine also inhibit acid secretion. Although Helicobacter pylori is associated with duodenal ulcer disease, most patients infected with the organism produce less than normal amount of acid. The cytoskeletal proteins ezrin and moesin participate in parietal cell acid and chief cell pepsinogen secretion, respectively.

However, the influence of HP eradication on the course of CU is poorly understood. AIM: to improve the diagnosis and treatment of urticaria patients with Helicobacter-associated diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients with clinical manifestations of urticaria and HP-associated gastroduodenal pathology in the age of .

Whereas in physical or distinct urticaria subtypes the evidence for infections is sparse, remission of annoying spontaneous chronic urticaria has been reported after successful treatment of persistent infections. Current summarizing available studies that evaluated the course of the chronic urticaria after proven Helicobacter eradication demonstrate a statistically significant benefit compared to untreated patients or Helicobacter-negative controls without urticaria (p < ).

There is evidence that Helicobacter pylori has a critical role in different extragastric diseases such as chronic urticaria. We present a case of chronic urticaria in an adult patient with H. pylori infection and disease regression after triple anti-H. pylori therapy. In contrast to the autoimmune mechanisms involved in chronic urticaria against which no specific treatment strategy has been developed, infections with H. pylori could be treated with triple therapy.

Treatment regimens included a clarithromycin- or metronidazole-containing -day triple therapy with one of several proton pump inhibitors and vonoprazan. RESULTS: Clarithromycin resistance increased annually and was higher in women and younger patients (< years). Rates of metronidazole resistance were stable but decreased with age. Hp treatment regimens using PPIs had eradication rates of % and % among clarithromycin-sensitive and clarithromycin-resistant cases, respectively, while regimens including vonoprazan had eradication rates of around % regardless of clarithromycin susceptibility. In particular, triple therapy with vonoprazan, amoxicillin, and metronidazole achieved % eradication. CONCLUSION: Clarithromycin-containing triple therapy even using vonoprazan did not achieve satisfactory eradication rates even in the clarithromycin-sensitive group. To avoid antibiotic misuse in population with low metronidazole resistance, -day vonoprazan, amoxicillin, and metronidazole triple therapy might be a strong candidate as a first-line eradication therapy."", 'Update on clarithromycin resistance in Helicobacter pylori in Hong Kong and its effect on clarithromycin-based triple therapy.. AIM: To determine the antibiotic susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori and evaluate the efficacy of a clarithromycin-based triple therapy in relation to antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Consecutive patients referred for upper endoscopy due to dyspeptic symptoms were recruited. Gastric biopsies were obtained for the CLO test, histology and culture. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed by the E-test. Patients with H. pylori infection received rabeprazole mg, clarithromycin mg, and amoxicillin , mg, all twice daily for days. RESULTS: Of patients recruited, were H. pylori-positive and culture was successful in patients.

A total of patients received -week triple therapy with rabeprazole mg, clarithromycin mg, and amoxicillin , mg, all twice daily, and patients attended the follow-up test. Eradication rates by per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis were and %, respectively. The eradication rate by per protocol was significantly higher in patients with clarithromycin-susceptible strains than in those with clarithromycin-resistant strains ( vs. %, p < ). CONCLUSION: Clarithromycin resistance reduces the clinical efficacy of clarithromycin-based triple therapy. However, due to the low prevalence of clarithromycin resistance, clarithromycin-based therapy is still the first choice for clinical use.']",clarithromycin; therapy; triple; eradication; amoxicillin; mg; rates; resistance; metronidazole; regimen,clarithromycin · therapy · triple

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori is one of the most important causes of the varied spectrum of gastroduodenal diseases. It is important to have a rapid diagnostic method to detect the organism so as to initiate the treatment early and check its progression to malignancy. AIMS: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of rapid urease biopsy test in detecting H. pylori infection and implementation of ""test and treat"" policy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients of chronic dyspepsia not responding to conventional treatment were subjected to endoscopy, and mucosal biopsy samples were collected.

RESULTS: The specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of RUT were %, %, %, %, and %, respectively. CONCLUSION: Use of a rapid diagnostic test viz., rapid urease biopsy test to confirm H. pylori infection is recommended for early diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori associated gastroduodenal diseases.', 'Evaluation of a locally produced rapid urease test for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection.. BACKGROUND: The rapid urease test (RUT) is used at Groote Schuur Hospital for diagnosing Helicobacter pylori infection. This is an in-house method, which has not been validated. OBJECTIVE: To validate our practice of reading the RUT immediately after endoscopy (RUT()), by comparing this with a reading at hours (RUT()) and with histological analysis. DESIGN: Ninety consecutive patients undergoing upper endoscopy over a -week period from October to November , and in whom rapid urease testing was indicated, were included in the study. Patients with recent exposure (within weeks of endoscopy) to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and antibiotics (confounders) were noted and included in the cohort. Two antral and two body biopsies were taken for histological examination and a third antral biopsy was placed in the RUT bottle. Both haematoxylin and eosin and modified Giemsa staining methods were used to identify H. pylori. The RUT was read immediately (within minutes of upper endoscopy) (RUT()), as per our current practice, and each specimen was re-read at hours (RUT()). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and the impact of confounders were calculated. RESULTS: Of the patients undergoing rapid urease testing, % were male and % were female, with a mean age of years (range - years). Histological examination revealed H. pylori in % (N=) of the biopsy specimens. In the patients without confounders, the sensitivity and specificity of the RUT() were % and % respectively, and % and % for RUT(). After including the patients with confounders, the sensitivity and specificity were % and % for RUT(), and % and % for RUT() respectively. Thirteen RUT() specimens (%) that were initially negative became positive at the RUT() reading. There were (%) RUT()- and RUT()-negative but histology-positive specimens. Four of these false-negative RUT() results could be accounted for by a low H. pylori density on histological analysis ( patients were taking PPIs). Confounders did not alter the sensitivity and specificity outcomes or impact on the number of false-negative RUTs. CONCLUSIONS: Our locally prepared RUT is a specific test for the detection of H. pylori infection. The sensitivity is greatly enhanced by reading the test at hours. The use of PPIs, H()RAs and antibiotics preceding endoscopy did not impact significantly on the results.', 'Accuracy of rapid urease test in diagnosing Helicobacter pylori infection in patients using NSAIDs..

BACKGROUND: The relationship between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has been confirmed; however, no clear evidence for the effectiveness of H. pylori eradication on ITP exists thus far. The purpose of this study was to investigate platelet recovery in chronic ITP after H. pylori eradication. METHODS: A total of patients ( male, female; the median age of years) diagnosed with ITP, whose platelet counts were less than ×()/µL, were enrolled. They were tested for H. pylori infection by the rapid urea test or urea breath test. All patients received triple therapy for or days to eradicate H. pylori infection. RESULTS: Of the patients, (%) were diagnosed with H. pylori infection. Of all the ITP patients, (%) exhibited a complete response (CR) to H. pylori eradication therapy; (%), a partial response (PR); and (%) were nonresponsive (NR). Predictive factors of response after H. pylori eradication therapy were platelet counts at the initial response (% responders among patients with platelet counts <×()/µL vs % responders among patients with platelet counts ≥×()/µL, P<) and H. pylori infectivity (% responders among the H. pylori positive patients vs % responders among the H. pylori negative patients, P=). CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the efficacy of H. pylori eradication in increasing the platelet count in ITP patients.

Several recent studies have suggested that an association exists between Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication and improvement in platelet count in a significant proportion of patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In this controlled study, we prospectively examined adult patients with chronic ITP for HP infection, and assessed the effect of HP eradication on platelet count. One hundred forty-two consecutive Iranian patients with chronic ITP were assessed. Those who met the criteria and had platelet counts > x ()/L within the medication-free screening month were enrolled (n = ; females; mean age, +/- years). HP-positive patients received a -week course of triple HP eradication therapy (i.e., amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and omeprazole) and were followed for weeks. An ITP response was defined as a platelet count of > x ()/L weeks after treatment, together with an increase in the platelet count > x ()/L over the baseline value. HP infection was detected in (%) patients. HP-positive patients were significantly older than HP-negative subjects (P = ). HP eradication was successful in % (/) of those who completed the eradication therapy. Whereas % (/) of HP-eradicated patients showed an ITP response, no HP-negative patient had an ITP response. The ITP response persisted for weeks in % (/) of the responders. The ITP responders had a shorter disease duration than the nonresponders (P = ).

METHODS: A()C urea breath test for H. pylori infection was performed in a cohort of consecutive patients with ITP. Patients who tested positive received standard eradication therapy if their platelet count was < x ()/L or if they had symptoms of dyspepsia. RESULTS: H. pylori infection was detected in patients (%), and was not associated with dyspepsia or other clinical or laboratory features. Eradication therapy was successfully administered to patients. Platelet responses were observed in (%) of these patients, which lasted for more than year in patients. Duration of ITP was shorter among responders than nonresponders. Only one response was observed among patients with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < x ()/L). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with ITP is similar to that found in the general population. Infection is not associated with distinctive features of the disease. H. pylori eradication may improve the platelet counts in adults in whom the ITP is of recent onset and in those with less severe degrees of thrombocytopenia, but was not effective in patients with chronic severe ITP.']",itp; platelet; purpura; thrombocytopenic; idiopathic; count; counts; eradication; citp; response,itp · platelet · purpura

METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled consecutive patients who underwent curative ESD for EGC from to at a single tertiary hospital. The patients were divided into group (< years of age, n = ), group (age -, n = ), or group (≥ years of age, n = ). The clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared among the three age groups.

OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic resection is commonly used for early gastric cancer (EGC) in Korea and Japan. There are only a few reports of metachronous cancer after endoscopic resection. The aim of this study was to identify clinical factors associated with metachronous gastric cancer after endoscopic resection. METHODS: A total of patients with EGC who had underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) were periodically followed-up with endoscopic examinations from January to December . The incidence and variable factors of metachronous gastric cancer were investigated in a retrospective study. RESULTS: The median interval between the diagnosis of primary cancer and the diagnosis of the first metachronous cancer was months (range - months). Metachronous gastric cancer had developed in nine patients (%) during follow-up period and seven patients (%) had synchronous gastric cancer lesions within year of the initial endoscopic treatment. Annual incidence rate of metachronous cancer was approximately %. Antrum atrophy and old age were significantly associated with the incidence of metachronous cancer. The status of Helicobacter pylori, size, location and gross finding of lesion had no significant relationship with metachronous occurrence. CONCLUSIONS: We should examine more carefully older patients who have atrophic gastritis because secondary cancer including metachronous cancer might occur in remnant stomach after initial successful endoscopic resection. And prospective study will be needed for the optimal endoscopic surveillance interval.', 'Risk Factors for Metachronous Recurrence after Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection of Early Gastric Cancer.. Although endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is widely accepted as a curative treatment method for early gastric cancer (EGC) worldwide, metachronous recurrence often occurs after ESD for EGC. However, there are insufficient data about the role of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and other risk factors for recurrence. We aimed to compare the metachronous lesion in the H. pylori persistent group and the eradicated group, and to identify risk factors for metachronous lesion. We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent ESD between January and December . We excluded patients with dysplasia or patients who were not tested for H. pylori infection. One hundred eighty-five patients were enrolled. We studied risk factors for recurrence, and used survival analysis to test. There were patients with metachronous recurrence after ESD for EGC among the group. The incidence of metachronous gastric lesions after ESD for EGC developed more in the over -year-old group (P = ) and more in the H. pylori persistent group (P = ).

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of medications in the United States. By inhibiting gastric H/K adenosine triphosphatase via covalent binding to the cysteine residues of the proton pump, they provide the most potent acid suppression available. Long-term PPI use accounts for the majority of total PPI use. Absolute indications include peptic ulcer disease, chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use, treatment of Helicobacter pylori, and erosive esophagitis. Although PPIs are generally considered safe, numerous adverse effects, particularly associated with long-term use have been reported. Many patients receiving chronic PPI therapy do not have clear indications for their use, prompting consideration for reduction or discontinuation of their use. This article reviews the indications for PPI use, the adverse effects/risks involved with their use, and conditions in which their use is controversial.', ""[Current use of proton pump inhibitors and when to limit, stop or not start treatment].. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion that have changed treatment practice for gastric acid-related disorders. The major adequate indications for their use are treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcers, eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection in combination with antibiotics and prophylaxis for patients on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory or antiplatelet drugs. Since their introduction, clinical success has been accompanied by widespread use of PPIs, which has steadily increased over the last decades without concomitant increase in the incidence of acid-related disorders. PPIs are now among the most widely prescribed class of medications worldwide and around % of Icelanders are current PPI users. This increase has been linked to PPI prescription without an indication, or continued use for longer duration than recommended. In recent years, concerns have been raised about PPI overuse and the associated increased risk of harm, not only in terms of increased costs but also the potential risk of physical dependence and long-term side effects of PPIs. The article is based on search in PubMed, the authors' own clinical experience and research, and is intended to provide practice advice on the use of PPIs with focus on appropriate prescription and deprescription of PPIs."", ""The risks of long-term use of proton pump inhibitors: a critical review.. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most frequently prescribed medications. Their use is likely even higher than estimated due to an increase in the number of PPIs available without a prescription. Appropriate indications for PPI use include Helicobacter pylori infection, erosive esophagitis, gastric ulcers, and stress ulcer prevention in high-risk critically ill patients. Unfortunately, PPIs are often used off-label for extended periods of time. This increase in PPI usage over the past two decades has called into question the long-term effects of these medications. The association between PPI use and infection, particularly Clostridium difficile and pneumonia, has been the subject of several studies. It's proposed that the alteration in gastrointestinal microflora by PPIs produces an environment conducive to development of these types of infections. At least one study has suggested that long-term PPI use increases the risk of dementia. Drug interactions are an important and often overlooked consideration when prescribing any medication. The potential interaction between PPIs and antiplatelet agents has been the subject of multiple studies. One of the more recent concerns with PPI use is their role in the development or progression of chronic kidney disease. There is also some literature suggesting that PPIs contribute to the development of various micronutrient deficiencies. Most of the literature examining the potential adverse effects of PPI use is composed of retrospective, observation studies.

Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in approximately % to % of adults in the United States. Risk factors include malabsorptive processes, limited dietary intake of vitamin B12, use of certain medications (eg, metformin, proton pump inhibitors), and older age. Symptoms vary based on the severity of vitamin B12 deficiency but may include fatigue, brain fog, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia. Although universal screening is not recommended, testing should be considered in patients with at least one risk factor for and one clinical feature of vitamin B12 deficiency. Initial testing includes total serum vitamin B12 level, which is diagnostic for deficiency if less than pg/mL. Borderline levels (- pg/mL) warrant a methylmalonic acid measurement, which is diagnostic for vitamin B12 deficiency if elevated. Patients without a clear cause of deficiency should undergo further testing for atrophic gastritis with a Helicobacter pylori test and evaluation for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune gastritis. Oral vitamin B12 supplementation can be used in most patients and is noninferior to intramuscular supplementation. Intramuscular administration should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or neurologic manifestations.

BACKGROUND: To determine the role of vitamin B12 deficiency in pernicious anemia and the efficacy of oral vitamin B12 replacement therapy given regardless of the etiology, and to compare the endoscopic and pathological findings in patients diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency. METHODS: The study included patients, aged - years, diagnosed with vitamin B12 level < pg/mL between May and May . Evaluation was made of the demographic characteristics of the patients, diseases, drugs used, dietary habits, previous use of vitamin B12 replacement therapy, family history of vitamin B12 deficiency, laboratory test values, and neurological symptoms present at the time of presentation. Endoscopy was applied to all the patients included in the study. Anti-parietal cell antibody (APCA) and anti-intrinsic factor antibody (AIFA) analyses were applied to all patients. RESULTS: Evaluation was made of a total of patients diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency, comprising (%) females and (%) males. The mean vitamin B12 level of the patients was determined as pg/mL at the time of presentation and pg/mL after treatment. APCA positivity was determined in (%) patients, and AIFA positivity in (%) patients. Atrophy was determined endoscopically in (%) patients and pathologically in (%). Helicobacter pylori positivity was determined in (%) patients. A diagnosis of pernicious anemia (PA) was made in (%) patients (patients with AIFA positivity or APCA accompanied by corpus atrophy). APCA positivity was determined but not corpus atrophy in (%) patients and these cases were accepted as suspected pernicious anemia. In this study of patients with vitamin B12 deficiency, stomach pathologies which could cause vitamin B12 deficiency (atrophic gastritis, HP, PA) and the responses to oral replacement therapy were investigated. As vitamin B12 absorption plays a role in the pathogenesis. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to atrophic gastritis, and this was determined with biopsy in % of the patients. APCA positivity was determined in % of the patients investigated with respect to autoimmune atrophic gastritis (pernicious anemia) and AIFA positivity in %. A diagnosis of PA was made in (%) patients from autoimmune marker positivity and the presence of corpus atrophic gastritis. HP was determined in % of the patients with vitamin B12 deficiency, and although no correlation was determined between HP and atrophy, HP positivity was determined in (%) of the patients with pathological atrophy. From the time of diagnosis, the patients in the study were prescribed , µg/day vitamin B12. At the -day follow-up examination, a significant increase was observed in the vitamin B12 levels of % of the patients. At the end of the study, as oral replacement therapy was seen to be effective to a great extent, even in patients with PA, it was concluded that for patients not responding to oral replacement therapy, it would be appropriate to apply parenteral vitamin B12 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In developing countries such as Turkey, the role of HP infection in vitamin B12 deficiency must be kept in mind. The incidence of atrophic gastritis and pernicious anemia is higher than expected in vitamin B12 deficiency. Thus, it can be concluded that it is appropriate to investigate patients with vitamin B12 deficiency with respect to atrophic gastritis and PA, and oral replacement therapy should be the first stage in the treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency.']",vitamin; b12; deficiency; cobalamin; folate; vitamins; homocysteine; supplementation; serum; levels,vitamin · b12 · deficiency

Flagellar biogenesis in bacteria is a complex process in which the transcription of dozens of structural and regulatory genes is coordinated with the assembly of the flagellum. Although the overall process of flagellar biogenesis is conserved among bacteria, the mechanisms used to regulate flagellar gene expression vary greatly among different bacterial species. Many bacteria use the alternative sigma factor σ () (also known as RpoN) to transcribe specific sets of flagellar genes. These bacteria include members of the Epsilonproteobacteria (e.g., Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni), Gammaproteobacteria (e.g., Vibrio and Pseudomonas species), and Alphaproteobacteria (e.g., Caulobacter crescentus). This review characterizes the flagellar transcriptional hierarchies in these bacteria and examines what is known about how flagellar gene regulation is linked with other processes including growth phase, quorum sensing, and host colonization.', 'Requirement of the flagellar protein export apparatus component FliO for optimal expression of flagellar genes in Helicobacter pylori.. Flagellar biogenesis in Helicobacter pylori involves the coordinated expression of flagellar genes with assembly of the flagellum. The H. pylori flagellar genes are organized into three regulons based on the sigma factor needed for their transcription (RpoD [σ()], RpoN [σ()], or FliA [σ()]). Transcription of RpoN-dependent genes is activated by a two-component system consisting of the sensor kinase FlgS and the response regulator FlgR. While the cellular cues sensed by the FlgS/FlgR two-component system remain to be elucidated, previous studies revealed that disrupting certain components of the flagellar export apparatus inhibited transcription of the RpoN regulon. FliO is the least conserved of the membrane-bound components of the export apparatus and has not been annotated for any of the H. pylori genomes sequenced to date. A PSI-BLAST analysis identified a potential H. pylori FliO protein which membrane topology algorithms predict to possess a large N-terminal periplasmic domain that is absent from FliO of Escherichia coli and Salmonella, the paradigms for flagellar structure/function studies. FliO was necessary for flagellar biogenesis as well as wild-type levels of motility and transcription of RpoN-dependent and FliA-dependent flagellar genes in H. pylori strain B128. FliO also appears to be required for wild-type levels of the export apparatus protein FlhA in the membrane. Interestingly, the periplasmic and cytoplasmic domains were somewhat dispensable for flagellar gene regulation and assembly, suggesting that these domains have relatively minor roles in flagellar synthesis.', 'Basal Body Structures Differentially Affect Transcription of RpoN- and FliA-Dependent Flagellar Genes in Helicobacter pylori.. UNLABELLED: Flagellar biogenesis in Helicobacter pylori is regulated by a transcriptional hierarchy governed by three sigma factors, RpoD (σ()), RpoN (σ()), and FliA (σ()), that temporally coordinates gene expression with the assembly of the flagellum. Previous studies showed that loss of flagellar protein export apparatus components inhibits transcription of flagellar genes. The FlgS/FlgR two-component system activates transcription of RpoN-dependent genes though an unknown mechanism. To understand better the extent to which flagellar gene regulation is coupled to flagellar assembly, we disrupted flagellar biogenesis at various points and determined how these mutations affected transcription of RpoN-dependent (flaB and flgE) and FliA-dependent (flaA) genes. The MS ring (encoded by fliF) is one of the earliest flagellar structures assembled. Deletion of fliF resulted in the elimination of RpoN-dependent transcripts and an ∼-fold decrease in flaA transcript levels. FliH is a cytoplasmic protein that functions with the C ring protein FliN to shuttle substrates to the export apparatus. Deletions of fliH and genes encoding C ring components (fliM and fliY) decreased transcript levels of flaB and flgE but had little or no effect on transcript levels of flaA. Transcript levels of flaB and flgE were elevated in mutants where genes encoding rod proteins (fliE and flgBC) were deleted, while transcript levels of flaA was reduced ∼-fold in both mutants. We propose that FlgS responds to an assembly checkpoint associated with the export apparatus and that FliH and one or more C ring component assist FlgS in engaging this flagellar structure. IMPORTANCE: The mechanisms used by bacteria to couple transcription of flagellar genes with assembly of the flagellum are poorly understood. The results from this study identified components of the H. pylori flagellar basal body that either positively or negatively affect expression of RpoN-dependent flagellar genes. Some of these basal body proteins may interact directly with regulatory proteins that control transcription of the H. pylori RpoN regulon, a hypothesis that can be tested by examining protein-protein interactions in vitro.']",flagellar; motility; flagella; motor; flagellum; mutant; assembly; proteins; export; flha,flagellar · motility · flagella

Disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are common and distressing nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) that can adversely affect levodopa absorption and lead to OFF periods, also known as motor fluctuations. Gastroparesis, which is primarily defined as delayed gastric emptying (DGE), and Helicobacter pylori infection, which is present with increased frequency in PD, are among the most common and important GI disorders reported in PD that may impair oral levodopa absorption and increase OFF time. Symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, postprandial bloating, fullness, early satiety, abdominal pain, and weight loss. DGE has been reported in a substantial fraction of individuals with PD. Symptoms of H. pylori infection include gastritis and peptic ulcers. Studies have found that DGE and H. pylori infection are correlated with delayed peak levodopa plasma levels and increased incidence of motor fluctuations. Therapeutic strategies devised to minimize the potential that gastric complications will impair oral levodopa absorption and efficacy in PD patients include treatments that circumvent the GI tract, such as apomorphine injection, levodopa intestinal gel delivery, levodopa inhalation powder, and deep brain stimulation.

BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests an association between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and Parkinson's disease (PD) and its clinical manifestations, but the causal relationship remain largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the causal relationship between HP infection and PD risk, PD symptoms, and secondary parkinsonism, we conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS: We obtained summary data from genome-wide association studies for seven different antibodies specific to HP proteins and five PD-related phenotypes. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-Egger methods were used to assess the causal relationships. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the stability of the MR results and reverse MR analysis was conducted to evaluate the presence of reverse causality. RESULTS: Genetically predicted HP antibodies were not causally associated with an increased risk of PD. However, HP cytotoxin-associated gene-A (CagA) and outer membrane protein (OMP) antibody level were causally associated with PD motor subtype (tremor to postural instability/gait difficulty score ratio; β = - and , P = and , respectively). HP vacuolating cytotoxin-A (VacA) antibody level was causally associated with an increased risk of PD dementia [odds ratio (OR) = , P = ]. Additionally, HP OMP antibody level was identified as a risk factor for drug-induced secondary parkinsonism (OR = , P = ). These results were stable, showed no evidence of heterogeneity or directional pleiotropy, and no evidence of a reverse causal relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that HP infection does not increase the risk of PD, but contributes to PD motor and cognitive symptoms. Different types of HP antibodies affect different symptoms of PD. Eradication of HP infection may help modulate and improve symptoms in PD patients."", ""Stomaching the Possibility of a Pathogenic Role for Helicobacter pylori in Parkinson's Disease.. While a small subset of Parkinson's disease cases have genetic causes, most cases are sporadic and may have an environmental contributor that has largely remained enigmatic. Remarkably, gastrointestinal symptoms in PD patients serve as a prodrome for the eventual motor dysfunctions. Herein, we review studies exploring a possible link between the gastric human pathogen Helicobacter pylori and PD. We provide plausible and testable hypotheses for how this organism might contribute to PD: ) a toxin(s) produced by the bacteria; ) disruption of the intestinal microbiome; ) local inflammation that crosses the gut-brain axis, leading to neuroinflammation; and ) manipulation of the pharmacokinetics of the PD drug levodopa by H. pylori, even in those not receiving exogenous levodopa. Key findings are: ) people with PD are --fold more likely to be infected with H. pylori than people without PD; ) H. pylori-infected PD patients display worse motor functions than H. pylori-negative PD patients; ) eradication of H. pylori improves motor function in PD patients over PD patients whose H. pylori was not eradicated; and ) eradication of H. pylori improves levodopa absorption in PD patients compared to that of PD patients whose H. pylori was not eradicated. Evidence is accumulating that H. pylori has a link with PD, but the mechanism is unclear. Future work should explore the effects of H. pylori on development of PD in defined PD animal models, focusing on the roles of H. pylori toxins, inflammation, levodopa absorption, and microbiome dysbiosis.""]",pd; parkinsons; levodopa; motor; parkinsonism; disease; pdl1; fluctuations; ip; ldopa,parkinsons · levodopa · motor

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived vesicles important in intercellular communication that play an essential role in host-pathogen interactions, spreading pathogen-derived as well as host-derived molecules during infection. Pathogens can induce changes in the composition of EVs derived from the infected cells and use them to manipulate their microenvironment and, for instance, modulate innate and adaptive inflammatory immune responses, both in a stimulatory or suppressive manner. Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide and infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is considered the main risk factor for developing this disease, which is characterized by a strong inflammatory component. EVs released by host cells infected with H. pylori contribute significantly to inflammation, and in doing so promote the development of disease. Additionally, H. pylori liberates vesicles, called outer membrane vesicles (H. pylori-OMVs), which contribute to atrophia and cell transformation in the gastric epithelium. In this review, the participation of both EVs from cells infected with H. pylori and H. pylori-OMVs associated with the development of gastric cancer will be discussed. By deciphering which functions of these external vesicles during H. pylori infection benefit the host or the pathogen, novel treatment strategies may become available to prevent disease.', 'Helicobacter pylori outer membrane vesicles involvement in the infection development and Helicobacter pylori-related diseases.. Helicobacter pylori - (H. pylori) play a role in the pathogenesis of gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers as well as gastric cancer. A possible involvement of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by H. pylori in the distribution of bacterial antigens through the gastric epithelial barrier and their role in the development of local and systemic host inflammatory and immune responses has been suggested. OMVs contain various biologically active compounds, which internalize into host cells affecting signaling pathways and promoting apoptosis of gastric epithelial and immunocompetent cells. OMVs-associated H. pylori virulence factors may strengthen or downregulate the immune responses leading to disease development. This review describes the biological importance of H. pylori OMVs and their role in the course of H. pylori infections, as well as H. pylori related local and systemic effects.', 'Outer Membrane Vesicle Production by Helicobacter pylori Represents an Approach for the Delivery of Virulence Factors CagA, VacA and UreA into Human Gastric Adenocarcinoma (AGS) Cells.. Helicobacter pylori infection is the etiology of several gastric-related diseases including gastric cancer. Cytotoxin associated gene A (CagA), vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) and α-subunit of urease (UreA) are three major virulence factors of H. pylori, and each of them has a distinct entry pathway and pathogenic mechanism during bacterial infection. H. pylori can shed outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Therefore, it would be interesting to explore the production kinetics of H. pylori OMVs and its connection with the entry of key virulence factors into host cells. Here, we isolated OMVs from H. pylori , strain and characterized their properties and interaction kinetics with human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells. We found that the generation of OMVs and the presence of CagA, VacA and UreA in OMVs were a lasting event throughout different phases of bacterial growth. H. pylori OMVs entered AGS cells mainly through macropinocytosis/phagocytosis. Furthermore, CagA, VacA and UreA could enter AGS cells via OMVs and the treatment with H. pylori OMVs would cause cell death. Comparison of H. pylori , and clinical strains suggested that the production and characteristics of OMVs are not only limited to laboratory strains commonly in use, but a general phenomenon to most H. pylori strains.']",omvs; vesicles; outer; membrane; evs; omv; cells; pyloriderived; extracellular; host,omvs · vesicles · outer

BACKGROUND: Aberrant DNA methylation is induced by aging and chronic inflammation in normal tissues. The induction by inflammation is widely recognized as acceleration of age-related methylation. However, few studies addressed target genomic regions and the responsible factors in a genome-wide manner. Here, we analyzed methylation targets by aging and inflammation, taking advantage of the potent methylation induction in human gastric mucosa by Helicobacter pylori infection-triggered inflammation. RESULTS: DNA methylation microarray analysis of , CpG probes, grouped into , genomic blocks, revealed that high levels of methylation were induced in , (%) genomic blocks by inflammation, even after correction of the influence of leukocyte infiltration. A total of % of the hypermethylation was acceleration of age-related methylation while % was specific to inflammation. Regions with H3K27me3 were frequently hypermethylated both by aging and inflammation. Basal methylation levels were essential for age-related hypermethylation while even regions with little basal methylation were hypermethylated by inflammation. When limited to promoter CpG islands, being a microRNA gene and high basal methylation levels strongly enhanced hypermethylation while H3K27me3 strongly enhanced inflammation-induced hypermethylation. Inflammation was capable of overriding active transcription. In young gastric mucosae, genes with high expression and frequent mutations in gastric cancers were more frequently methylated than in old ones. CONCLUSIONS: Methylation by inflammation was not simple acceleration of age-related methylation. Targets of aberrant DNA methylation were different between young and old gastric mucosae, and driver genes were preferentially methylated in young gastric mucosa.', 'Persistence of a component of DNA methylation in gastric mucosae after Helicobacter pylori eradication.. BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection potently induces aberrant DNA methylation in gastric mucosae, and its accumulation is associated with gastric cancer risk. Cross-sectional analysis of methylation levels (fraction of methylated DNA molecules) and temporal analysis of methylation incidence suggested that methylation levels decrease after HP infection discontinues. We aimed to demonstrate the decrease in methylation levels. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with HP infection who had undergone curative endoscopic resection and healthy volunteers were recruited. Methylation levels were quantified by real-time methylation-specific PCR. Histology was evaluated according to the updated Sydney System. RESULTS: In the patients with successful eradication, the FLNc methylation level, along with infiltration of inflammatory cells, decreased from to % at weeks (P = ) and remained low at year. The THBD methylation level (%) remained high at weeks, but decreased to % at year (P = ). Nine healthy volunteers with successful eradication tended to show a decrease of both FLNc and THBD at weeks. However, the methylation levels after the decrease were still higher than those of healthy individuals without HP infection. In the patients with persistent infection, the methylation levels remained the same. Before eradication, the THBD methylation level correlated with the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration (P < ). CONCLUSIONS: Methylation levels in gastric mucosae decreased to certain levels after HP eradication in profiles unique to individual markers. Involvement of chronic inflammation in methylation induction was suggested.', 'The presence of a methylation fingerprint of Helicobacter pylori infection in human gastric mucosae.. Aberrant DNA methylation is deeply involved in human cancers, but its inducers and targets are still mostly unclear. Helicobacter pylori infection was recently shown to induce aberrant methylation in gastric mucosae, and produce a predisposed field for cancerization. Here, we analyzed the presence of target genes in methylation induction by H. pylori and the mechanism for the gene specificity. Noncancerous gastric mucosae were collected from groups of individuals (with and without a gastric cancer, and with and without current H. pylori infection; N = for each group), and methylation of promoter CpG islands of genes that can be methylated in gastric cancer cell lines was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR. In total, genes were consistently methylated in individuals with current or past infection by H. pylori, whereas genes were not methylated at all. In addition, genes were randomly or intermediately methylated in individuals with gastric cancers and the remaining gene was methylated in all the cases. The methylation-susceptible genes had significantly lower mRNA expression levels than the methylation-resistant genes. H. pylori infection did not induce mRNA and protein expression of DNA methyltransferases; DNMT1, DNMT3A or DNMT3B. Gene specificity was present in the induction of aberrant DNA methylation by H. pylori infection, and low mRNA expression, which could precede methylation, was one of the mechanisms for the gene specificity. These findings open up the possibility that a methylation fingerprint can be used as a novel marker for past exposure to a specific carcinogenic factor.']",methylation; cpg; hypermethylation; dna; epigenetic; promoter; genes; methylated; aberrant; gastric,methylation · cpg · hypermethylation

Background: The biological role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in field cancerization is unknown. To investigate the involvement of miRNAs in gastric field cancerization, we evaluated the expression profile of ten miRNAs and their diagnostic value. Methods: We used three groups of FFPE gastric samples: non-cancer (NC), cancer adjacent (ADJ) and gastric cancer (GC). The expression profiles of hsa-miR-10a, -miR-, -miR-29c, -miR-135b, -miR-148a, -miR-, -miR-, -miR-, -miR- and -miR-664a were investigated using qRT-PCR. The results obtained by qRT-PCR were validated in Small RNA-Seq data from the TCGA database. The search for target genes of the studied miRNAs was performed in the miRTarBase public database and miRTargetLink tool, using experimentally validated interactions. In addition, we also performed the functional analysis of these genes using enrichment in KEGG pathways. The potential as biomarker was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the derived area under the curve (AUC>) analysis. Results: The miRNAs hsa-miR-10a, -miR-, -miR-135b, hsa-miR-148a, -miR-, -miR-, -miR-, -miR- and -miR-664a were up-regulated in ADJ and GC compared to NC (P<); and hsa-miR- and -miR-135b were up-regulated in GC compared to ADJ (P<). Hsa-miR-148a, -miR-, -miR-, -miR- and -miR-664a were not differentially expressed between GC and ADJ, suggesting that both share similar changes (P>). The TS-miR hsa-miR-29c was up-regulated in ADJ compared to NC and GC (P<); we did not observe a significant difference in the expression of this miRNA between NC and GC. This feature may be an antitumor mechanism used by cancer-adjacent tissue because this miRNA regulates the BCL-, CDC42 and DMNT3A oncogenes. The expression level of hsa-miR- was associated with Helicobacter pylori infection status (P<). Functional analysis using the genes regulated by the studied miRNAs showed that they are involved in biological pathways and cellular processes that are critical for the establishment of H. pylori infection and for the onset, development and progression of GC. hsa-miR-10a, -miR-, -miR-135b, -miR-148a, -miR-, -miR-, -miR- and -miR-664a were able to discriminate NC from other tissues with great accuracy (AUC>). Conclusion: The studied miRNAs are closely related to field cancerization, regulate genes important for gastric carcinogenesis and can be potentially useful as biomarkers in GC.', 'Novel Risk Associations between microRNA Polymorphisms and Gastric Cancer in a Chilean Population.. Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in the world, with variations across geographical regions and ethnicities. Emerging evidence indicates that miRNA expression is dysregulated in GC and its polymorphisms may contribute to these variations, which has yet to be explored in Latin American populations. In a case-control study of GC patients and healthy donors from Chile, we assessed the association of polymorphisms in miRNA genes. Two novel polymorphisms were found to be associated with GC: rs4822739:C>G (miR-548j) and rs701213:T>C (miR-). Additionally, rs1553867776:T>TCCCCA (miR-) and rs12416605:C>T (miR-) were associated with intestinal-type GC, and rs4822739:C>G (miR-548j) and rs1439619:T>G (miR-) with TNM I-II stage. The polymorphisms rs6149511:T> TGAAGGGCTCCA (miR-), rs404337:G>A (miR-), and rs1439619:T>G (miR-) were identified among H.pylori-infected GC patients and rs7500280:T>C (miR-) and rs1439619:T>G (miR-) were found among H. pylori cagPAI+ infected GC cases. Prediction analysis suggests that seven polymorphisms could alter the secondary structure of the miRNA, and the other one is located in the seed region of miR-. Targets of miRNAs are enriched in GC pathways, suggesting a possible biological effect. In this study, we identified seven novel associations and replicated one previously described in Caucasian population. These findings contribute to the understanding of miRNA genetic polymorphisms in the GC pathogenesis.', 'Plasma microRNAs, miR-223, miR-21 and miR-218, as novel potential biomarkers for gastric cancer detection.. BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous small non-coding RNAs, are stably detected in human plasma. Early diagnosis of gastric cancer (GC) is very important to improve the therapy effect and prolong the survival of patients. We aimed to identify whether four miRNAs (miR-, miR-, miR- and miR-) closely associated with the tumorigenesis or metastasis of GC can serve as novel potential biomarkers for GC detection. METHODOLOGY: We initially measured the plasma levels of the four miRNAs in GC patients and healthy control subjects by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and then compared plasma miRNA results with the expressions in cancer tissues from eight GC patients. Finally, the presence of miR-, miR- and miR- in the plasma was validated in GC patients and healthy control subjects, and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of these miRNAs were analyzed. RESULTS: We found that the plasma levels of miR- (P<) and miR- (P<) were significantly higher in GC patients than in healthy controls, while miR- (P<) was significantly lower. The ROC analyses yielded the AUC values of for miR-, for miR- and for miR-, and combined ROC analysis revealed the highest AUC value of in discriminating GC patients from healthy controls. Moreover, the plasma levels of miR- (P<) and miR- (P = ) were significantly higher in GC patients with stage I than in healthy controls. Furthermore, the plasma levels of miR- were significantly higher in GC patients with helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection than those without (P = ), and significantly higher in healthy control subjects with Hp infection than those without (P = ).

Helicobacter pylori infects the human gastric mucosa causing a chronic infection that is the primary risk factor for gastric cancer development. Recent studies demonstrate that H. pylori promotes tolerogenic dendritic cell (DC) development indicating that this bacterium evades the host immune response. However, the signaling pathways involved in modulating DC activation during infection remain unclear. Here, we report that H. pylori infection activated the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) pathway in murine bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) and splenic DCs isolated ex vivo. Isogenic cagA-, cagE-, vacA- and urease-mutants exhibited levels of phosphoSTAT3 that were comparable to in the wild-type (WT) parent strain. H. pylori-infected BMDCs produced increased immunosuppressive IL-, which activated STAT3 in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. Neutralization of IL- prevented H. pylori-mediated STAT3 activation in both BMDCs and splenic DCs. In addition, anti-IL- treatment of infected H. pylori-BMDCs was associated with increased CD86 and MHC II expression and enhanced proinflammatory IL-1β cytokine secretion. Finally, increased CD86 and MHC II expression was detected in H. pylori-infected STAT3 knockout DCs when compared to WT controls. Together, these results demonstrate that H. pylori infection induces IL- secretion in DCs, which activates STAT3, thereby modulating DC maturation and reducing IL-1β secretion. These findings identify a host molecular mechanism by which H. pylori can manipulate the innate immune response to potentially favor chronic infection and promote carcinogenesis.', ""Chronic exposure to Helicobacter pylori impairs dendritic cell function and inhibits Th1 development.. Helicobacter pylori causes chronic gastric infection that affects the majority of the world's population. Despite generating an inflammatory response, the immune system usually fails to clear the infection. Since dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in shaping the immune response, we investigated the effects of H. pylori on DC function. We have demonstrated that H. pylori increased the expression of activation markers on DCs while upregulating the inhibitory B7 family molecule, PD-L1. Functionally, H. pylori-treated DCs resulted in the production of interleukin- (IL-) and IL- but not of alpha interferon (IFN-alpha). While very little or no IL- was produced to H. pylori alone, simultaneous ligation of CD40 on DCs induced IL- release. We also demonstrated that DCs treated with H. pylori-induced IFN-gamma production by allogeneic naive T cells. However, stimulation of DCs with H. pylori for an extended period of time impaired their ability to produce cytokines after CD40 ligation and limited their ability to promote IFN-gamma release, suggesting that the DCs had become exhausted by the prolonged stimulation. The effect of chronic infection with H. pylori on DC function was further investigated by focusing on DC development. Demonstrating that monocytes differentiated into DCs in the presence of H. pylori exhibited an exhausted phenotype with an impaired ability to produce IL- and a downregulation of CD1a. Our results raise the possibility that in chronic H. pylori infection DCs become exhausted after prolonged antigen exposure leading to suboptimal Th1 development. This effect may contribute to persistence of H. pylori infection."", 'Helicobacter pylori defines local immune response through interaction with dendritic cells.. The bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori colonizes the human gastric and duodenal mucosa, evades clearance by the host response and is associated with peptic ulcer disease and an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma. Dendritic cells (DCs) are initiators of the immune response to H. pylori. The aim of the current study was to investigate the interaction between H. pylori with DCs. To determine the impact of H. pylori on the maturation and the activation of monocyte-derived DCs, the effect of clinical H. pylori strains with different inflammatory backgrounds on adenocarcinoma gastric epithelial cells was investigated. The inflammatory background was defined according to the degree of lymphocyte and granulocyte infiltration and the bacterial density at the site of infection. DC maturation and activation varied after exposure to the different strains. While maturation appeared to be independent of any virulence factor tested, a significant increase in the average level of cytokine production was observed for the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin- (IL-), tumour necrosis factor-α, IL- and IL-1β when comparing strains with low inflammatory backgrounds with those of the medium or high backgrounds. In conclusion, the DC response towards different strains in vitro was associated with the clinical outcome of the individual host, suggesting a major role of this cell type in modulating strain-specific H. pylori infection.']",dcs; dendritic; dc; cells; il; response; maturation; immune; responses; cell,dcs · dendritic · cells

RESULTS: One hundred H. pylori-infected patients (mean age ± years, % men) were randomized. All were CYP3A4 extensive metabolizers. Cure rates with both -day vonoprazan dual therapy and -day triple therapy were low: %; % CI = -% (/), and %; % CI = -%) (/), respectively. In contrast, -day high-dose vonoprazan triple therapy and -day vonoprazan triple plus bismuth proved effective %; % CI = %-% (/) and %; % CI = %-% (/), respectively. CONCLUSION: Both -day vonoprazan dual and triple therapy were ineffective for H. pylori eradication in Thailand. Higher dosage of vonoprazan, and/or the addition of bismuth may be required to achieve high H. pylori eradication rates. High-dose vonoprazan triple therapy and vonoprazan triple therapy adding bismuth might be used as first-line treatments in some regions with high efficacy irrespective of CYP3A4/ genotype and clarithromycin resistance.', 'Vonoprazan Triple and Dual Therapy for Helicobacter pylori Infection in the United States and Europe: Randomized Clinical Trial.. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Novel, effective treatments for Helicobacter pylori infection are needed. This study evaluated the efficacy of vonoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker, vs standard treatment on H pylori eradication in the United States and Europe. METHODS: In a randomized, controlled, phase trial, treatment-naïve adults with H pylori infection were randomized :: to open-label vonoprazan dual therapy ( mg vonoprazan twice daily; g amoxicillin times daily), or double-blind triple therapy twice a day (vonoprazan mg or lansoprazole mg; amoxicillin g; clarithromycin mg) for days. The primary outcome was noninferiority in eradication rates in patients without clarithromycin- and amoxicillin-resistant strains (noninferiority margin = %). Secondary outcomes assessed superiority in eradication rates in clarithromycin-resistant infections, and in all patients. RESULTS: A total of patients were randomized. Primary outcome eradication rates (nonresistant strains): vonoprazan triple therapy %, dual therapy %, vs lansoprazole triple therapy % (both noninferior; difference %; % confidence interval [CI], - to ; P < .; difference -%; % CI, - to ; P = ., respectively). Eradication rates in clarithromycin-resistant infections: vonoprazan triple therapy %, dual therapy %, vs lansoprazole triple therapy % (both superior; difference %; % CI, -; P < .; difference %; % CI, -; P < ., respectively). In all patients, vonoprazan triple and dual therapy were superior to lansoprazole triple therapy (% and %, respectively, vs %, difference %; % CI, -; P < .; difference %; % CI, -; P = .). Overall frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between vonoprazan and lansoprazole regimens (P > .).

Bismuth salts exert their activity within the upper gastrointestinal tract through action of luminal bismuth. Bismuth exerts direct bactericidal effect on Helicobacter pylori by different ways: forms complexes in the bacterial wall and periplasmic space, inhibits different enzymes, ATP synthesis, and adherence of the bacteria to the gastric mucosa. Bismuth also helps ulcer healing by acting as a barrier to the aggressive factors and increasing mucosal protective factors such as prostaglandin, epidermal growth factor, and bicarbonate secretion. To date, no resistance to bismuth has been reported. Also synergism between bismuth salts and antibiotics was present. It was shown that metronidazole and clarithromycin resistant H. pylori strains become susceptible if they are administered together with bismuth. Bismuth-containing quadruple therapy was recommended both by the Second Asia-Pacific Consensus Guidelines and by the Maastricht IV/Florence Consensus Report as an alternative first choice regimen to standard triple therapy, in areas with low clarithromycin resistance, and it is recommended as the first-line therapeutic option in areas with a high prevalence of clarithromycin resistance. Greater than % eradication success can be obtained by bismuth-containing quadruple therapy. Choosing bismuth as an indispensable part of first-line therapy is logical as both metronidazole and clarithromycin resistances can be overcome by adding bismuth to the regimen.', ""A proteomic approach for the identification of bismuth-binding proteins in Helicobacter pylori.. Helicobacter pylori is a major human pathogen that can cause peptic ulcers and chronic gastritis. Bismuth-based triple or quadruple therapies are commonly recommended for the treatment of H. pylori infections. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying treatment with bismuth are currently not fully understood. We have conducted a detailed comparative proteomic analysis of H. pylori cells both before and after treatment with colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS). Eight proteins were found to be significantly upregulated or downregulated in the presence of CBS ( microg mL(-)). Bismuth-induced oxidative stress was confirmed by detecting higher levels of lipid hydroperoxide (approximately times) and hemin (approximately times), in whole cell extracts of bismuth-treated H. pylori cells, compared with those from untreated cells. The presence of bismuth also led to an approximately eightfold decrease in cellular protease activities. Using immobilized-bismuth affinity chromatography, we isolated and subsequently identified seven bismuth-binding proteins from H. pylori cell extracts. The intracellular levels of four of these proteins (HspA, HspB, NapA and TsaA) were influenced by the addition of CBS, which strongly suggests that they interact directly with bismuth. The other bismuth-interacting proteins identified were two enzymes (fumarase and the urease subunit UreB), and a translational factor (Ef-Tu). Our data suggest that the inhibition of proteases, modulation of cellular oxidative stress and interference with nickel homeostasis may be key processes underlying the molecular mechanism of bismuth's actions against H. pylori."", 'In Vitro Susceptibility and Synergistic Effect of Bismuth Against Helicobacter pylori.. Background/objectives: Bismuth is commonly used in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy. However, few studies have examined the in vitro susceptibility of H. pylori to bismuth. Moreover, the exact mechanism of action of bismuth on H. pylori remains unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the anti-bacterial effect of bismuth as well as to evaluate potential synergistic effects between bismuth and various antibiotics. Methods: The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of three bismuth preparations, bismuth subsalicylate, bismuth potassium citrate, and colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS, De-Nol) were determined for H. pylori strains using the agar dilution technique. Agar plates of varying pH values from to were used to investigate whether acidity influences the anti-bacterial effect of bismuth. A checkerboard assay was performed to assess the synergism between CBS and antibiotics (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole). Results: Twelve H. pylori strains, including three reference strains (H. pylori , J99, and ATCC ), and nine clinically isolated strains were tested. The MICs for bismuth subsalicylate, bismuth potassium citrate, and CBS ranged from to μg/mL, to μg/mL, and to μg/mL, respectively. The bismuth MICs for the reference strains were similar at pH -. In the checkerboard assay, no interactions between CBS and any of the antibiotics were observed in the reference H. pylori strains. Conclusions: Bismuth showed in vitro susceptibility against H. pylori. The enhanced eradication efficacy of bismuth-containing regimens appears to be due to mechanisms other than direct synergy with antibiotics.']",bismuth; cbs; complexes; bismuthiii; drugs; compounds; bi; activity; biiii; subcitrate,bismuth · cbs · complexes

BACKGROUND: In addition to Helicobacter pylori infection, host genetic factors contribute to gastric cancer (GC). Recognition of H. pylori is known to involve Toll-like receptors (TLR), which subsequently leads to activation of NF-κB. Thus, the overall aim of this study was to estimate for the first time the pooled effect size of polymorphisms in TLR2, TLR4 and CD14 on GC development through a meta-analysis. METHODS: A case-control study comprising ethnic Chinese individuals ( non-cardia GC cases and functional dyspepsia controls) was conducted for the genotyping of TLR2 - to -174del, CD14 - C/T and TLR4 rs11536889 using PCR, RT-PCR and mass spectrometry. Case-control studies of TLR2, TLR4 and CD14 polymorphisms and GC were searched up to June . Pooled odds ratios and % confidence intervals were obtained by means of the random effects model. RESULTS: In our ethnic Chinese case-control study, the TLR4 rs11536889 C allele increased the risk of GC (OR: , %CI: -) while the CD14 - T allele was protective (OR: , %CI: -).

The levels of gastric cytokines were detected by ELISA. H. pylori-positivity or duodenal ulcer were not associated with TLR2, TLR4 or TLR5 polymorphisms. Otherwise, the presence of TLR4 polymorphic allele was associated with infection by cagA-positive strains and with increased gastric levels of interleukin- and interleukin-.

RESULTS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms TLR4+1196C/T was not associated with risk of chronic gastritis or gastric cancer and the homozygous genotypes TLR4+896GG and TLR4+1196TT were absent in the studied population. However, the frequency of TLR2 - to - ins/del + del/del and TLR4+896AG genotypes was significantly higher (P < and P = , respectively) in the cancer group (% and %, respectively) than in the control group (% and %, respectively).

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori gastritis affects two-thirds of the world's human population. Among various invasive and non-invasive tests, histology play a very important role in detecting H. pylori in gastric biopsies. In histology, for detection of H. pylori, we use different histological staining techniques like routine haematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stain, Giemsa stain, Gimenez stain, and periodic acid Schiff - Alcian blue (PAS-AB) stain. OBJECTIVE: Aim of our study was to evaluate these different histopathological staining techniques for detecting H. pylori in gastric mucosal biopsies and to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy of H&E stain, Gemenez stain and PAS-AB in the detection of H. pylori in gastric biopsies using Giemsa stain as the reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a prospective descriptive study design of gastric biopsies of patients having gastritis. This study was conducted at Vivekananda Polyclinic and Institute of Medical Sciences over a period of one year, from March to February . From each formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded block, four glass slides were prepared and stained with H&E stain, Giemsa stains, Gemenez stain, and PAS-AB stain to detect the presence/absence of H. pylori in gastric biopsies. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy were assessed. RESULTS: Various staining techniques for detecting H. pylori in gastric mucosal biopsies were compared. In reference to Giemsa stain results, statistical analysis indicates that the diagnostic accuracy of the Gimenez stain, H&E stain, and PAS-AB stain were %, %, and % respectively. Gimenez stain is confirmed to be better than H&E stain and PAS-AB stain to detect H. pylori in gastric biopsies of patients having gastritis. PAS-AB stain is the worst stain to detect H. pylori in gastric biopsies. CONCLUSION: Gimenez stain has higher diagnostic accuracy than PAS-AB stain in the detection of H. pylori in gastric biopsy. In fact, Gimenez stain has high sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy as compared to traditional H&E stain while PAS-AB stain has lower sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy.

BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has been extensively implicated in the etiology and pathogenesis of gastric ulcers and carcinomas, which has necessitated its efficient and cost-effective identification in gastric biopsy samples. We have sought to compare various staining methods, namely, Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Giemsa, and Modified Toluidine Blue (MTB), with immunohistochemistry (IHC; gold standard) in terms of efficacy, staining costs, and duration of performing the stains in settings with limited resources. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Gastric biopsy specimens of patients who presented with gastritis symptoms were stained with H&E, Giemsa, MTB, and IHC. The sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values, and the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated for each stain. RESULTS: In all, cases of were positive for H. pylori on IHC. The specificity for both H&E and Giemsa was %, whereas it was lower for MTB (%). The sensitivity of H&E was much lower (%) compared with the other stains (% Giemsa, % MTB). The most inexpensive and time-consuming stain was H&E followed by MTB and Giemsa. CONCLUSION: When H&E is used alone for H. pylori detection, a significant number of cases may be overlooked, especially mild inflammatory cases and when coccoid forms of the bacteria are present. This study proposes the use of either Giemsa or MTB as reliable alternatives for IHC in resource-limited settings to combat the high prevalence of H. pylori in the developing world.', 'Routine Anti-Helicobacter Immunohistochemical Staining is Significantly Superior to Reflex Staining Protocols for the Detection of Helicobacter in Gastric Biopsy Specimens.. BACKGROUND: The role of special stains in the detection of H. pylori is controversial; some pathologists claim that hematoxylin and eosin staining alone is adequate to detect bacteria, while others maintain that immunohistochemical staining must be used on all gastric biopsies. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that hematoxylin and eosin and histochemical special stains have similar sensitivity and that immunohistochemical staining only marginally enhances the detection rate of the organisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of all gastric biopsies examined in a large pathology laboratory between January , and December , were extracted and stratified according to the stain used for the detection of Helicobacter (. hematoxylin and eosin only; . Upfront HP Blue; . Upfront HP Blue including reflex immunohistochemistry; . Upfront anti-Helicobacter immunohistochemical staining.

A total of , gastric biopsy sets were stained with histochemical stains only, and , with anti-Helicobacter immunohistochemical stain; in of these, an immunohistochemical stain was also performed. In cases, only hematoxylin and eosin were performed. In this latter group, % of patients were Helicobacter-positive; in the upfront HP Blue, the prevalence was %, whereas patients with upfront immunohistochemistry had a prevalence of % (p < ., compared to hematoxylin and eosin only). CONCLUSIONS: There was a dramatic improvement in detection of H. pylori infection through the use of upfront immunohistochemical stains. Therefore, we contend that the routine use of IHC for all gastric biopsies is an appropriate protocol to ensure that every patient gets the right answer.']",stain; biopsies; staining; stains; biopsy; giemsa; ihc; detection; specimens; de,stain · biopsies · staining

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a Gram negative bacterium that colonizes the stomach of almost half human population. It has evolved to escape immune surveillance, establishes lifelong inflammation, predisposing to genomic instability and DNA damage, notably double strand breaks. The epithelial host cell responds by activation of DNA damage repair (DDR) machinery that seems to be compromised by the infection. It is therefore now accepted that genetic damage is a major mechanism operating in cases of H. pylori induced carcinogenesis. Here, we review the data on the molecular pathways involved in DNA damage and DDR activation during H. pylori infection.', 'DNA damage and repair in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric mucosa cells.. Helicobacter pylori is a common human pathogen and its infection is believed to contribute to gastric cancer. Impaired DNA repair may fuel up cancer transformation by the accumulation of mutation and increased susceptibility to exogenous carcinogens. To evaluate the role of infection of H. pylori in DNA damage and repair we determined: () the level of endogenous basal, oxidative and alkylative DNA damage, and () the efficacy of removal of DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide and the antibiotic amoxicillin in the H. pylori-infected and non-infected GMCs. DNA damage and the efficacy of DNA repair were evaluated by the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Specific damage to the DNA bases were assayed with the DNA repair enzymes formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg) recognizing oxidized DNA bases and -methyladenine-DNA glycosylase II (AlkA) recognizing alkylated bases. The level of basal and oxidative DNA in the infected GMCs was higher than non-infected cells. H. pylori-infected GMCs displayed enhanced susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide than control cells. There was no difference between the efficacy of DNA repair in the infected and non-infected cells after treatment with hydrogen peroxide and amoxicillin. Our results indicate that H. pylori infection may be correlated with oxidative DNA damage in GMCs. Therefore, these features can be considered as a risk marker for gastric cancer associated with H. pylori infection and the comet assay may be applied to evaluate this marker.', 'Carcinogenic bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori triggers DNA double-strand breaks and a DNA damage response in its host cells.. The bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori chronically infects the human gastric mucosa and is the leading risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. The molecular mechanisms of H. pylori-associated gastric carcinogenesis remain ill defined. In this study, we examined the possibility that H. pylori directly compromises the genomic integrity of its host cells. We provide evidence that the infection introduces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in primary and transformed murine and human epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The induction of DSBs depends on the direct contact of live bacteria with mammalian cells. The infection-associated DNA damage is evident upon separation of nuclear DNA by pulse field gel electrophoresis and by high-magnification microscopy of metaphase chromosomes. Bacterial adhesion (e.g., via blood group antigen-binding adhesin) is required to induce DSBs; in contrast, the H. pylori virulence factors vacuolating cytotoxin A, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, and the cytotoxin-associated gene (Cag) pathogenicity island are dispensable for DSB induction. The DNA discontinuities trigger a damage-signaling and repair response involving the sequential ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent recruitment of repair factors--p53-binding protein (53BP1) and mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein (MDC1)--and histone H2A variant X (H2AX) phosphorylation. Although most breaks are repaired efficiently upon termination of the infection, we observe that prolonged active infection leads to saturation of cellular repair capabilities. In summary, we conclude that DNA damage followed by potentially imprecise repair is consistent with the carcinogenic properties of H. pylori and with its mutagenic properties in vitro and in vivo and may contribute to the genetic instability and frequent chromosomal aberrations that are a hallmark of gastric cancer.']",dna; damage; repair; oxidative; cells; breaks; muty; stress; ros; carcinogenesis,dna · damage · repair

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection leads to a systemic low-grade inflammatory state and has been associated causally with a diverse spectrum of extra-gastric disorders. Among them, the infection has been involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD), but only one study had evaluated children. Therefore, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a cohort of children and adolescents, randomly assessed among those followed up for thyroid diseases in a university pediatric endocrinology service: with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and with ATD. All children were asymptomatic, under strict control on levothyroxine replacement, and reported no other diseases or use of drugs. Helicobacter pylori status was evaluated by the 13C-Urea Breath Test (13C-UBT). Antithyroid antibodies (ATPO, antiTg, and TRAb) and serum thyroid hormones (TSH, free T4, and T3) were assessed by standard assays. Data were analyzed in logistic models by the SPSS statistical software package, and a p-value ≤ was considered statistically significant. The prevalence of H. pylori infection was % in children with ATD. Neither the gender nor the serum levels of thyroid hormones and antithyroid antibodies were associated with the H. pylori-positive status. Thirty-seven (%) children with CH were infected with H. pylori. The mean T3 serum level ( ± ) was significantly lower (p = ) in the infected children than in those free from the infection ( ± ), association that remained after adjustment for the other variables in the multivariate analysis. Because no difference was observed in the levels of TSH and T4, the results indicate that the infection may lead to impairment in the thyroid hormonal balance, but not in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function. In as much as H. pylori infection is highly widespread and the prevalence of CH is also not negligible, additional studies are required to confirm our results and to identify the involved mechanisms.', 'Factors influencing the levothyroxine dose in the hormone replacement therapy of primary hypothyroidism in adults.. Levothyroxine (LT4) is a safe, effective means of hormone replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Here, we review the pharmaceutical, pathophysiological and behavioural factors influencing the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of LT4. Any factor that alters the state of the epithelium in the stomach or small intestine will reduce and/or slow absorption of LT4; these include ulcerative colitis, coeliac disease, bariatric surgery, Helicobacter pylori infection, food intolerance, gastritis, mineral supplements, dietary fibre, resins, and various drugs. Once in the circulation, LT4 is almost fully bound to plasma proteins. Although free T4 (FT4) and liothyronine concentrations are extensively buffered, it is possible that drug- or disorder-induced changes in plasma proteins levels can modify free hormone levels. The data on the clinical significance of genetic variants in deiodinase genes are contradictory, and wide-scale genotyping of hypothyroid patients is not currently justified. We developed a decision tree for the physician faced with an abnormally high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level in a patient reporting adequate compliance with the recommended LT4 dose. The physician should review medications, the medical history and the serum FT4 level and check for acute adrenal insufficiency, heterophilic anti-TSH antibodies, antibodies against gastric and intestinal components (gastric parietal cells, endomysium, and tissue transglutaminase ), and Helicobacter pylori infection. The next step is an LT4 pharmacodynamic absorption test; poor LT4 absorption should prompt a consultation with a gastroenterologist and (depending on the findings) an increase in the LT4 dose level. An in-depth etiological investigation can reveal visceral disorders and, especially, digestive tract disorders.', 'Levothyroxine liquid oral substitution as an alternative treatment for refractory hypothyroidism due to gastrointestinal malabsorption: A case report.. Tablets of levothyroxine (LT4) are the most used form for the treatment of hypothyroidism. Some patients may present with refractory hypothyroidism despite a high daily LT4 dose. We report the case of a -year-old woman who was admitted to our department for refractory hypothyroidism. She was treated with μg oral LT4 tablets daily ( μg/kg/day). Despite good compliance and regular intake of high doses of LT4, she had persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of mIU/L. LT4 absorption test was consistent with the diagnosis of malabsorption. Etiological investigations revealed Helicobacter pylori gastritis. Helicobacter infection was adequately treated, but symptoms of hypothyroidism and elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone persisted. Increased LT4 doses ( μg) failed to normalize thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Thus, she was put on LT4 liquid form at a dose of drops/day per day ( µg). Two weeks later, she presented with clinical and biological improvement with a normal free thyroxine level of ng/dL. Patients with gastrointestinal disorders may present with refractory hypothyroidism despite increasing doses of LT4.

The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is increasing at a rate greater than that of any other cancer in the Western world today. Barrett's esophagus is a clearly recognized risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, but the overwhelming majority of patients with Barrett's esophagus will never develop esophageal cancer. To date, dysplasia remains the only factor useful for identifying patients at increased risk for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma in clinical practice. Other epidemiologic risk factors include aging, gender, race, obesity, reflux symptoms, smoking, and diet. Factors that may protect against the development of adenocarcinoma include infection with Helicobacter pylori, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and consumption of aspirin and NSAIDs."", ""Current status and future perspectives on the etiology of esophageal adenocarcinoma.. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is the most common type of esophageal cancer in most Western countries and is an important contributor to overall cancer mortality. Most cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma are believed to arise from Barrett's esophagus. Esophageal adenocarcinoma occurs more frequently in white men over years old, as well as in people with frequent symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, in smokers and in people who are obese. Higher consumption of fruit and vegetables, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and infection with Helicobacter pylori have all been shown to reduce the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Here, we review the epidemiological evidence for the major risk factors of esophageal adenocarcinoma and also discuss perspectives for future research."", ""Etiology and risk factors for esophageal carcinoma.. Trends toward increasing incidence rates were observed for esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma in Western countries and were associated with trends toward stabilizing or declining incidence rates for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting that these tumors might be associated with distinct risk factors. Overweight and obesity have been consistently related to esophageal adenocarcinoma, but not to squamous cell carcinoma. Body mass index seems to be inversely related to the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The influence of obesity on esophageal adenocarcinoma and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma may be related to higher incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in obese persons since the risk of gastroesophageal reflux is strongly related to the risk for Barrett's esophagus. Tobacco smoking is a strong risk factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, but is only a weak risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Alcohol consumption is a strong risk factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, but is not consistently related to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Selenium, dietary fiber, fruits, vegetables and antioxidants are seen as protective factors. Male gender seems to be a risk factor for both types of tumors in the region, while infection with human papillomavirus does not seem to play a major part in the development of esophageal cancers. Infection with Helicobacter pylori is, however, an interesting factor to this region of tumors as discussed in many reports. It has been suggested that infection with H. pylori is protective to adenocarcinoma, but might be a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma, although the role of H. pylori in the etiology of these cancers remains somewhat unclear.""]",esophageal; adenocarcinoma; squamous; oesophageal; escc; eac; junction; carcinoma; incidence; esophagus,esophageal · adenocarcinoma · squamous

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Optimized regimen has not yet been established for failures of multiple Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of rifabutin-based rescue therapy, at least after three eradication failures. METHODS: Twelve patients, who failed in the treatment for H. pylori eradication at least three times, were consecutively enrolled between and at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. The rifabutin-based rescue regimen was consisted of proton pump inhibitor (PPI), rifabutin ( mg b.i.d.), and amoxicillin ( g b.i.d.), given for or days. MIC concentration test by the agar dilution method was performed on six patients prior to rifabutin-based rescue therapy. RESULTS: One patient did not take this regimen, and per-protocol (PP) analysis was performed in patients. The overall eradication rate by intention-to-treat and PP analysis with rifabutin-based rescue therapy was % (/ patients) and % (/ patients), respectively. There was no difference of the eradication rate depending on the underlying disease, smoking, alcohol, number of previous eradication failures, and CYP2C19 genotype. All of the six patients were susceptible to rifabutin, but only three of them succeeded in eradicating with H. pylori. Side effects occurred in two patients (%), and compliance was %. CONCLUSIONS: Even the eradication rate of rifabutin-based rescue therapy was not very good. Rifabutin-based rescue therapy could be considered as a rescue therapy, perhaps as the fourth or the fifth-line treatment option. No correlation of rifabutin sensitivity with eradication success rate of H. pylori suggests that frequent administration of high dose PPI and amoxicillin might be important.', 'Rifabutin-based high-dose proton-pump inhibitor and amoxicillin triple regimen as the rescue treatment for Helicobacter pylori..

AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of -day treatment regimen consisting rifabutin daily but increasing the dose of amoxicillin and lansoprazole in patients who have failed first and second eradication and to assess the side effect profiles in South Korea. METHODS: From December to May , H. pylori-infected patients with two previous eradication failures were enrolled for this study prospectively. The eligible patients were randomly assigned to either group A or B. Group A received lansoprazole mg bid, amoxicillin g tid and rifabutin mg bid during days, whereas group B received lansoprazole mg bid, amoxicillin g tid and rifabutin mg bid during days. RESULTS: In group A, H. pylori eradication was achieved in (%) of the patients in the ITT analysis and in (%) of the patients in the PP analysis. In group B, H. pylori eradication was achieved in (%) of the patients in the ITT analysis and in (%) of the patients in the PP analysis. There was statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of the eradication rates in PP analysis (p = .), whereas a marginally statistical significance was found in terms of the eradication rates in ITT analysis (p = .). Reported side effects were mild, and treatment was well tolerated. No major changes in physical examination or in standard laboratory parameters were observed after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Rifabutin-based high-dose proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-combined therapy as empirical rescue treatment is more effective than standard dose PPI-combined rifabutin-based therapy, safe and best tolerable in third-line therapy in the Korean population.

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of -day rifabutin, amoxicillin, and vonoprazan triple therapy as third- or later-line treatment for H. pylori infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who did not respond to second-line therapy were enrolled. After H. pylori infection was confirmed with the culture method, the patients received rifabutin-containing triple therapy ( mg vonoprazan b.i.d., mg amoxicillin q.i.d., and mg rifabutin q.d.) for days. Twelve weeks after the eradication therapy, successful eradication was confirmed using a C urea breath test or the H. pylori stool antigen test. The results obtained from our previous study that reported a -day or -day esomeprazole based rifabutin-containing triple therapy as a third- or fourth-line rescue therapy treated patients were used as historical control. We determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations of amoxicillin and rifabutin. We also evaluated whether the patients were positive for the mutation of the rpoB gene.

The causes of iron deficiency anemia include blood loss, increased demand, insufficient dietary intake, and disorders affecting iron absorption. In certain circumstances, atrophic gastritis, either autoimmune or due to Helicobacter pylori infection, may contribute. On very rare occasions, iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia can develop as a consequence of TMPRSS6 mutations. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed by identification of microcytic hypochromic anemia with low serum ferritin levels. In cases of chronic disorders such as chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, and chronic inflammatory disorders, the diagnosis may also incorporate transferrin saturation. Treatment of underlying diseases is recommended along with iron supplementation. While oral iron supplements are the first choice, intravenous iron may be considered when oral administration is impractical, iron absorption is impaired, or rapid iron replenishment is necessary. Recently, high-dose intravenous iron formulations became available in Japan, but their use requires caution due to potential risks of allergic reactions, hypophosphatemia/osteomalacia, iron overload, and vascular leakage. Notably, the benefits of high-dose intravenous iron for patients with heart failure and iron deficiency are recognized in the field of cardiology. This article provides an overview, incorporating recent developments in the field of iron deficiency anemia.', 'Anemia and iron deficiency in gastrointestinal and liver conditions.. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with a number of pathological gastrointestinal conditions other than inflammatory bowel disease, and also with liver disorders. Different factors such as chronic bleeding, malabsorption and inflammation may contribute to IDA. Although patients with symptoms of anemia are frequently referred to gastroenterologists, the approach to diagnosis and selection of treatment as well as follow-up measures is not standardized and suboptimal. Iron deficiency, even without anemia, can substantially impact physical and cognitive function and reduce quality of life. Therefore, regular iron status assessment and awareness of the clinical consequences of impaired iron status are critical. While the range of options for treatment of IDA is increasing due to the availability of effective and well-tolerated parenteral iron preparations, a comprehensive overview of IDA and its therapy in patients with gastrointestinal conditions is currently lacking. Furthermore, definitions and assessment of iron status lack harmonization and there is a paucity of expert guidelines on this topic. This review summarizes current thinking concerning IDA as a common co-morbidity in specific gastrointestinal and liver disorders, and thus encourages a more unified treatment approach to anemia and iron deficiency, while offering gastroenterologists guidance on treatment options for IDA in everyday clinical practice.', 'Iron Deficiency Anemia: Evaluation and Management.. Iron deficiency anemia is common worldwide. In adult patients without inflammation, a ferritin level of less than ng/mL or ferritin level of to ng/mL plus a transferrin saturation of less than % is diagnostic of iron deficiency. In patients with inflammation, a ferritin level of less than ng/mL is diagnostic. Risk factors for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status, female sex, age younger than years, and chronic inflammation. Underlying causes should be investigated. Recurrent blood loss is responsible for % of cases. In younger patients with a plausible cause of iron deficiency anemia (eg, heavy menstrual bleeding), a reasonable approach is to treat the bleeding and provide iron supplementation. In men and postmenopausal women, bidirectional endoscopy should be performed. Noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori infection and celiac disease is recommended because both are common causes of iron deficiency anemia. Oral iron replacement is the first-line treatment for most patients. However, intravenous iron is recommended in patients with heart failure to increase exercise capacity. Every-other-day dosing of oral iron improves absorption. Approximately % of patients have decreased adherence due to adverse effects.

RESULTS: The development of culture-independent methods facilitated the identification of many bacteria. Five major phyla have been detected in the stomach: Firmicutes, Bacteroidites, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria. At the genera level, the healthy human stomach is dominated by Prevotella, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Rothia and Haemophilus; however, the composition of the gastric microbiota is dynamic and affected by such factors as diet, drugs and diseases. The interaction between the pre-existing gastric microbiota and Helicobacter pylori infection might influence an individual's risk of gastric disease, including gastric cancer.

Little is known about the influence of gastric microbiota on host metabolism, even though the stomach plays an important role in the production of hormones involved in body weight regulation and glucose homeostasis. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and Helicobacter pylori alter gut microbiota, but their impact on gastric microbiota in patients with obesity and the influence of these factors on the metabolic response to bariatric surgery is not fully understood. Forty-one subjects with morbid obesity who underwent sleeve gastrectomy were included in this study. The H. pylori group was established by the detection of H. pylori using a sequencing-based method (n = ). Individuals in whom H. pylori was not detected were classified according to PPI treatment. Gastric biopsy specimens were obtained during surgery and were analyzed by a high-throughput-sequencing method. Patients were evaluated at baseline and , , and months after surgery. β-Diversity measures were able to cluster patients according to their gastric mucosa-associated microbiota composition. H. pylori and PPI treatment are presented as two important factors for gastric mucosa-associated microbiota. H. pylori reduced diversity, while PPIs altered β-diversity. Both factors induced changes in the gastric mucosa-associated microbiota composition and its predicted functions. PPI users showed lower percentages of change in the body mass index (BMI) in the short term after surgery, while the H. pylori group showed higher glucose levels and lower percentages of reduction in body weight/BMI year after surgery. PPIs and H. pylori colonization could modify the gastric mucosa-associated microbiota, altering its diversity, composition, and predicted functionality. These factors may have a role in the metabolic evolution of patients undergoing bariatric surgery. IMPORTANCE The gut microbiota has been shown to have an impact on host metabolism. In the stomach, factors like proton pump inhibitor treatment and Helicobacter pylori haven been suggested to alter gut microbiota; however, the influence of these factors on the metabolic response to bariatric surgery has not been fully studied. In this study, we highlight the impact of these factors on the gastric microbiota composition. Moreover, proton pump inhibitor treatment and the presence of Helicobacter pylori could have an influence on bariatric surgery outcomes, mainly on body weight loss and glucose homeostasis. Deciphering the relationship between gastric hormones and gastric microbiota and their contributions to bariatric surgery outcomes paves the way to develop gut manipulation strategies to improve the metabolic success of bariatric surgery.', ""Unlocking the secrets of the human gut microbiota: Comprehensive review on its role in different diseases.. The human gut microbiota, a complex and diverse community of microorganisms, plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health by influencing various physiological processes, including digestion, immune function, and disease susceptibility.

This review highlights key genera such as Enterococcus, Ruminococcus, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Escherichia coli, Akkermansia muciniphila, Firmicutes (including Clostridium and Lactobacillus), and Roseburia due to their well-established roles in immune regulation and metabolic processes, but other bacteria, including Clostridioides difficile, Salmonella, Helicobacter pylori, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, are also implicated in dysbiosis and various diseases. Pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, contribute to inflammation and cancer progression by disrupting immune responses and damaging tissues. The potential for microbiota-based therapies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary interventions, to improve health outcomes is examined. Future research directions in the integration of multi-omics, the impact of diet and lifestyle on microbiota composition, and advancing microbiota engineering techniques are also discussed.

DNA replication in Helicobacter pylori is initiated from a unique site (oriC) on its chromosome where several proteins assemble to form a functional replisome. The assembly of H. pylori replication machinery is similar to that of the model gram negative bacterium Escherichia coli except for the absence of DnaC needed to recruit the hexameric DnaB helicase at the replisome assembly site. In the absence of an obvious DnaC homologue inH. pylori, the question arises as to whether HpDnaB helicase is loaded at theHp-replication origin by itself or is assisted by other unidentified protein(s). A high-throughput yeast two-hybrid study has revealed two proteins of unknown functions (Hp0897 and Hp0340) that interact with HpDnaB. Here we demonstrate that Hp0897 interacts with HpDnaB helicase in vitro as well as in vivo Furthermore, the interaction stimulates the DNA binding activity of HpDnaB and modulates its adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis and helicase activities significantly. Prior complex formation of Hp0897 and HpDnaB enhances the binding/loading of DnaB onto DNA. Hp0897, along with HpDnaB, colocalizes with replication complex at initiation but does not move with the replisome during elongation. Together, these results suggest a possible role of Hp0897 in loading of HpDnaB at oriC."", 'The structure of a DnaA/HobA complex from Helicobacter pylori provides insight into regulation of DNA replication in bacteria.. Bacterial DNA replication requires DnaA, an AAA+ ATPase that initiates replication at a specific chromosome region, oriC, and is regulated by species-specific regulators that directly bind DnaA. HobA is a DnaA binding protein, recently identified as an essential regulator of DNA replication in Helicobacter pylori. We report the crystal structure of HobA in complex with domains I and II of DnaA (DnaA(I-II)) from H. pylori, the first structure of DnaA bound to one of its regulators. Biochemical characterization of the complex formed shows that a tetramer of HobA binds four DnaA(I-II) molecules, and that DnaA(I-II) is unable to oligomerize by itself. Mutagenesis and protein-protein interaction studies demonstrate that some of the residues located at the HobA-DnaA(I-II) interface in the structure are necessary for complex formation. Introduction of selected mutations into H. pylori shows that the disruption of the interaction between HobA and DnaA is lethal for the bacteria. Remarkably, the DnaA binding site of HobA is conserved in DiaA from Escherichia coli, suggesting that the structure of the HobA/DnaA complex represents a model for DnaA regulation in other Gram-negative bacteria. Our data, together with those from other studies, indicate that HobA could play a crucial scaffolding role during the initiation of replication in H. pylori by organizing the first step of DnaA oligomerization and attachment to oriC.', 'The role of Helicobacter pylori DnaA domain I in orisome assembly on a bipartite origin of chromosome replication.. The main roles of the DnaA protein are to bind the origin of chromosome replication (oriC), to unwind DNA and to provide a hub for the step-wise assembly of a replisome. DnaA is composed of four domains, with each playing a distinct functional role in the orisome assembly. Out of the four domains, the role of domain I is the least understood and appears to be the most species-specific. To better characterise Helicobacter pylori DnaA domain I, we have constructed a series of DnaA variants and studied their interactions with H. pylori bipartite oriC. We show that domain I is responsible for the stabilisation and organisation of DnaA-oriC complexes and provides cooperativity in DnaA-DNA interactions. Domain I mediates cross-interactions between oriC subcomplexes, which indicates that domain I is important for long-distance DnaA interactions and is essential for orisosme assembly on bipartite origins. HobA, which interacts with domain I, increases the DnaA binding to bipartite oriC; however, it does not stimulate but rather inhibits DNA unwinding. This suggests that HobA helps DnaA to bind oriC, but an unknown factor triggers DNA unwinding. Together, our results indicate that domain I self-interaction is important for the DnaA assembly on bipartite H. pylori oriC.']",dnaa; replication; helicase; dna; binding; oric; dnab; domain; protein; chromosome,dnaa · replication · helicase

Despite recent research focus on the association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and multiple sclerosis (MS) there is no consensus about the findings. To obtain a more comprehensive estimate of the association we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of H. pylori infection in MS patients and healthy controls. Pubmed and EMBASE were searched to identify eligible studies. Nine studies were selected for inclusion, involving cases ( patients with MS and controls). Overall, the prevalence of H. pylori infection in MS patients was lower than that in control groups (% vs. %, OR=, % CI: -, P<). Subgroup analysis revealed that the levels of H.pylori infection among MS patients were lower than for control subjects in Western countries (% vs. %, OR=, % CI: -, P=), but were not statistically significant in Eastern countries (% vs. %, OR=, % CI: -, P=). Our data show that H. pylori infection and MS is negatively correlated, especially in Western countries. Whether H. pylori infection is a protective factor against MS risk should thus be addressed in large-scale and prospective studies.', 'The protective effect of Helicobacter Pylori infection on the susceptibility of multiple sclerosis.. In recent years, a possible protective role of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) against autoimmune disease has been reported in an experimental murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS), and there are restricted conflicting epidemiologic data concerning Hp serology in MS patients. This study was aimed to determine the seroprevalence of Hp in MS patients and then investigates pro/anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in MS patients infected with HP and seronegative MS patients. Three hundred eighty-seven patients with MS were included in the study and were adjusted by gender and age to healthy subjects. An enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) was used to determine the presence of specific IgG antibodies against H. pylori in the serum sample of both groups. Some pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines levels were evaluated in seropositive/seronegative MS patients and healthy individuals. Our result showed that in patients with MS HP seropositivity was significantly lower than the healthy individual (P < .). Also, we showed that HP seropositive MS patients had lower Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) when compared with seronegative MS patients (P < .). Moreover, we illustrated that proinflammatory cytokine levels include IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-, and IL- in MS patients infected with HP were lower than seronegative MS patients. Besides, the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines include IL- and IL- was significantly higher in MS patients infected with HP when compared with MS patients seronegative for HP infection. In this study, we indicated that HP infection negatively correlated with MS, and conceivably may act as a protective agent against MS. The precise mechanism behind this protective effect remains elusive. However, it seems HP can modulate cytokine signaling, which involved in MS pathogenesis.', 'Relation of helicobacter pylori infection and multiple sclerosis in Iranian patients.. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent central nervous system demyelinating disease. There are known risk factors for MS. However, there is uncertainty in its protective factors. Few studies have demonstrated that some chronic infections may have protective effects on this disease. We carried this study to investigate the relation between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and the prevalence and severity of MS. In this case-control study, MS patients and sex- and age- matched controls were included. Blood samples for IgG and IgM anti HP antibodies were collected from all individuals. Also, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was used to evaluate the MS patients. Suitable statistical analysis was applied. A Significant difference was observed in seropositivity between these two groups (P<) but no significant difference was seen in seropositivity between conventional and opticospinal MS (P=). No significant difference was observed in seropositivity among ages (P=) and between genders (P=). A significant difference was seen in EDSS value between seropositive and seronegative patients (P=). We concluded that patients with HP infection had lower incidence of multiple sclerosis and MS patients with HP infection showed lower neurologic complications, which can demonstrate that HP infection may have a protective influence on MS pathogenesis.']",ms; sclerosis; ssc; systemic; multiple; nmosd; igg; csf; controls; autoimmune,sclerosis · ssc · systemic

METHODS: We evaluated seropositivity to H. pylori and to its cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) product in patients with various types of glaucoma and compared the findings to those of a control group of patients with cataract. RESULTS: H. pylori infection and CagA seropositivity were detected in / (%) and / (%) glaucoma patients compared with / (%) and / (%) control patients, respectively (P=, , not significant).

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the treatment of Helicobacter pylori gastric infection and changes in best-corrected visual acuity and macular detachment in patients with chronic central serous chorioretinopathy. METHODS: Seventeen patients diagnosed with central serous chorioretinopathy were examined for gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori using the urease test and gastric biopsy. Helicobacter pylory-positive patients were treated with the appropriate medication. The response to therapy was monitored by evaluating the best-corrected visual acuity and optical coherence tomography. The data were analyzed using Student's t-test before and after treatment. RESULTS: Fourteen patients ( eyes) aged - years (mean ± years) were positive for Helicobacter pylori. Most of the positive patients had gastric symptoms (%); one had bilateral central serous chorioretinopathy. The mean baseline best-corrected visual acuity was / (logMAR = ± ). Three months after starting treatment with antibiotics, the serous detachment had resolved in of eyes, but two cases required laser treatment. The follow-up period ranged from to months. The mean final best-corrected visual acuity differed significantly from baseline. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Helicobacter pylori infection may be present in many chronic central serous chorioretinopathy patients and that treatment for the infection may have a favorable effect on the outcome of chronic central serous chorioretinopathy.

Materials and Methods: A research in MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted and original studies investigating the relationship between H. pylori infection and glaucoma were included. Analysis was performed with random effects model. The main outcome was the odds ratio (OR) with % confidence intervals (CI) of H. pylori infection as a risk factor for glaucoma. A parallel analysis studied the role of active infection as indicated by histology and the titer of anti-H. pylori antibodies. For the anti-H. pylori antibody titers, weighted mean differences (WMD) were estimated between patients and controls. Results: Fifteen studies were included, with participants ( patients with glaucoma and controls), divided into primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), normal tension glaucoma (NTG) and pseudo-exfoliation glaucoma (PEG). The association between H. pylori infection and overall glaucoma was significant (OR = , CI % -) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = %). After stratification by glaucoma subtype, heterogeneity was eliminated in the NTG subgroup. Studies with healthy controls, and controls with anemia yielded very low or no heterogeneity, respectively.

While conducting experiments to investigate antimicrobial peptides of amphibians living in the Yunnan-Guizhou region of southwest China, a new family of antimicrobial peptides was identified from skin secretions of the Yunnan frog, Rana pleuraden. Members of the new peptide family named pleurain-As are composed of amino acids with a unique N-terminal sequence (SIIT) and a disulfide-bridged heptapeptide sequence (CRLYNTC). By BLAST search, pleurain-As had no significant similarity to any known peptides. Native and synthetic peptides showed antimicrobial activities against tested microorganisms including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. Twenty different cDNAs encoding pleurain-As were cloned from the skin cDNA library of R. pleuraden. The precursors of pleurain-As are composed of amino acid residues including predicted signal peptides, acidic propieces, and cationic mature antimicrobial peptides. The preproregion of pleurain-A precursor comprises a hydrophobic signal peptide of residues followed by an residue acidic propiece which terminates by a typical prohormone processing signal Lys-Arg. The preproregions of precursors are very similar to other amphibian antimicrobial peptide precursors but the mature pleurain-As are different from other antimicrobial peptide families. The remarkable similarity of preproregions of precursors that give rise to very different antimicrobial peptides in distantly related frog species suggests that the corresponding genes form a multigene family originating from a common ancestor. Furthermore, pleurain-As could exert antimicrobial capability against Helicobacter pylori. This is the first report of naturally occurring peptides with anti-H. pylori activity from Rana amphibians.', 'Single-molecule investigation of the interactions between reconstituted planar lipid membranes and an analogue of the HP(2-20) antimicrobial peptide.. In this study, we employed electrophysiology experiments carried out at the single-molecule level to study the mechanism of action of the HPA3 peptide, an analogue of the linear antimicrobial peptide, HP(-), isolated from the N-terminal region of the Helicobacter pylori ribosomal protein. Amplitude analysis of currents fluctuations induced by HPA3 peptide at various potentials in zwitterionic lipid membranes reveal the existence of reproducible conductive states in the stochastic behavior of such events, which directly supports the existence of transmembrane pores induced the peptide. From our data recorded both at the single-pore and macroscopic levels, we propose that the HPA3 pore formation is electrophoretically facilitated by trans-negative transmembrane potentials, and HPA3 peptides translocate into the trans monolayers after forming the pores. We present evidence according to which the decrease in the membrane dipole potential of a reconstituted lipid membranes leads to an augmentation of the membrane activity of HPA3 peptides, and propose that a lower electric dipole field of the interfacial region of the membrane caused by phloretin facilitates the surface-bound HPA3 peptides to break free from one leaflet of the membrane, insert into the membrane and contribute to pore formation spanning the entire thickness of the membrane.', 'The membrane insertion of helical antimicrobial peptides from the N-terminus of Helicobacter pylori ribosomal protein L1.. The interaction of two helical antimicrobial peptides, HPA3 and HPA3P with planar supported lipid membranes was quantitatively analysed using two complementary optical biosensors. The peptides are analogues of Hp(-) derived from the N-terminus of Helicobacter pylori ribosomal protein L1 (RpL1). The binding of these two peptide analogues to zwitterionic dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and negatively charged membranes composed of DMPC/dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) (:) was determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and dual polarisation interferometry (DPI). Using SPR analysis, it was shown that the proline substitution in HPA3P resulted in much lower binding for both zwitterionic and anionic membranes than HPA3. Structural changes in the planar DMPC and DMPC/DMPG (:) bilayers induced by the binding of both Hp(-) analogues were then resolved in real-time with DPI. The overall process of peptide-induced changes in membrane structure was analysed by the real-time changes in bound peptide mass as a function of bilayer birefringence. The insertion of both HPA3 and HPA3P into the supported lipid bilayers resulted in a decrease in birefringence with increasing amounts of bound peptide which reflects a decrease in the order of the bilayer. The binding of HPA3 to each membrane was associated with a higher level of bound peptide and greater membrane lipid disordering and a faster and higher degree of insertion into the membrane than HPA3P. Furthermore, the binding of both HPA3 and HPA3P to negatively charged DMPC/DMPG bilayers also leads to a greater disruption of the lipid ordering. These results demonstrate the geometrical changes in the membrane upon peptide insertion and the extent of membrane structural changes can be obtained quantitatively. Moreover, monitoring the effect of peptides on a structurally characterised bilayer has provided further insight into the role of membrane structure changes in the molecular basis of peptide selectivity and activity and may assist in defining the mode of antimicrobial action.']",peptides; peptide; antimicrobial; activity; against; hpa3; cathelicidin; antiadhesive; hpa3nt3; amps,peptides · peptide · antimicrobial

BACKGROUND: In vitro studies have shown that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection induces autophagy in gastric epithelial cells. However, prolonged exposure to H. pylori reduces autophagy by preventing maturation of the autolysosome. The alterations of the autophagy-related genes in H. pylori infection are not yet fully understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed autophagy-related gene expression in H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa compared with uninfected gastric mucosa obtained from Bhutanese volunteers with mild dyspeptic symptoms. We also studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of autophagy-related gene in Bhutanese participants to identify the influence on susceptibility to H. pylori infection. RESULTS: Microarray analysis of autophagy-related genes showed that genes were upregulated (%) and nine were downregulated (%). We used quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to measure mRNA levels of the downregulated genes (ATG16L1, ATG5, ATG4D, and ATG9A) that were core molecules of autophagy. ATG16L1 and ATG5 mRNA levels in H. pylori-positive specimens (n=) were significantly less than those in H. pylori-negative specimens (n=). ATG16L1 mRNA levels were inversely related to H. pylori density. We also compared SNPs of ATG16L1 (rs2241880) among H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative subjects. The odds ratio for the presence of H. pylori in the GG genotype was (% CI: -) relative to the AA/AG genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Autophagy-related gene expression profiling using high-throughput microarray analysis indicated that downregulation of core autophagy machinery genes may depress autophagy functions and possibly provide a better intracellular habit for H. pylori in gastric epithelial cells.', '[Impact of Helicobacter pylori infection on autophagy of different cells--a review].. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative pathogen that widely colonizes in the human gastric mucosa, and is associated with various gastric diseases. Recently, much attention has been aroused on the relationship between H. pylori infection and autophagy. Accumulating evidence suggests that H. pylori can induce autophagy in gastric epithelial cells and professional phagocytes. Both the virulent factors of H. pylori and host autophagic proteins have been demonstrated to affect H. pylori-induced autophagy. Besides, the process of autophagy plays an important role in determining the intracellular fate of H. pylori. Here, we review the impact of H. pylori infection on autophagy of different cells.', 'Molecular mechanism of Helicobacter pylori-induced autophagy in gastric cancer.. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative pathogen that colonizes gastric epithelial cells. The drug resistance rates of H. pylori have dramatically increased, causing persistent infections. Chronic infection by H. pylori is a critical cause of gastritis, peptic ulcers and even gastric cancer. In host cells, autophagy is stimulated to maintain cellular homeostasis following intracellular pathogen recognition by the innate immune defense system. However, H. pylori-induced autophagy is not consistent during acute and chronic infection. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the association between H. pylori infection and autophagy in gastric epithelial cells could aid the understanding of the mechanisms of persistent infection and the identification of autophagy-associated therapeutic targets for H. pylori infection. The present review describes the role of H. pylori and associated virulence factors in the induction of autophagy by different signaling pathways during acute infection. Additionally, the inhibition of autophagy in gastric epithelial cells during chronic infection was discussed. The present review summarized H. pylori-mediated autophagy and provided insights into its mechanism of action, suggesting the induction of autophagy as a novel therapeutic target for persistent H. pylori infection.']",autophagy; autophagic; cells; intracellular; autophagyrelated; lysosomal; vaca; atg16l1; autophagosomes; apoptosis,autophagy · autophagic · cells

Innate immunity represents the first barrier against bacterial invasion. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) belong to the large family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), and their activation leads to the induction of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, antigen-presenting molecules, and costimulatory molecules. Recent studies have focused on identifying the association between TLRs and Helicobacter pylori- (H. pylori-) related diseases. Therefore, this minireview focuses on assessing the role of these TLRs in the development of H. pylori-related gastropathies. Both TLR2 and TLR were found to be involved in H. pylori LPS recognition, with contradictory results most likely due to both the inability to obtain pure LPS in experimental studies and the heterogeneity of the bacterial LPS. In addition, TLR2 was found to be the most extensively expressed gene among all the TLRs in gastric tumors. High levels of TLR4 were also associated with a higher risk of gastric cancer. TLR5 was initially associated with the recognition of H. pylori flagellin, but it seems that this bacterium has developed mechanisms to escape this recognition representing an important factor involved in the persistence of this infection and subsequent carcinogenesis. TLR9, the only TLR with both anti- and proinflammatory roles, was involved in the recognition of H. pylori DNA. The dichotomous role of TLR9, promoting or suppressing the infection, depends on the gastric environment. Recently, TLR7 and TLR8 were shown to recognize purified H. pylori RNA, thereby inducing proinflammatory cytokines. TLR1 and TLR10 gene polymorphisms were associated with a higher risk for gastric cancer in H. pylori-infected individuals. Different gene polymorphisms of these TLRs were found to be associated with gastric cancer depending mostly on ethnicity. Further studies are required in order to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies against H. pylori infections based on the functions of TLRs.', 'Toll-like receptor 2: An important immunomodulatory molecule during Helicobacter pylori infection.. Toll like receptors (TLRs) are an essential subset of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) which identify the microbial components and contribute in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses against the infectious agents. The TLRs, especially TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9, participate in the induction of immune response against H. pylori. TLR2 is expressed on a number of immune and non-immune cells and recognizes a vast broad of microbial components due to its potential to form heterodimers with other TLRs, including TLR1, TLR6 and TLR10. A number of H. pylori-related molecules may contribute to TLR2-dependent responses, including HP-LPS, HP-HSP60 and HP-NAP. TLR2 plays a pivotal role in regulation of immune response to H. pylori through activation of NF-κB and induction of cytokine expression in epithelial cells, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils and B cells. The TLR2-related immune response that is induced by H. pylori-derived components may play an important role regarding the outcome of the infection toward bacterial elimination, persistence or pathological reactions. The immunomodulatory and immunoregulatory roles of TLR2 during H. pylori infection were considered in this review. TLR2 could be considered as an interesting therapeutic target for treatment of H. pylori-related diseases.', ""The contribution of toll-like receptor 2 on Helicobacter pylori activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway in gastric epithelial cells.. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a spiral shaped gram-negative bacterium that induces immune responses in the gastric mucosa. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play important roles in mediating inflammatory cytokines by recognition of conserved molecular patterns on bacteria. Changes in the expression of toll-like receptor (TLR) , TLR4 and the relative inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in normal gastric epithelial GES- cells following treatment with H. pylori or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (E. coli LPS) in order to investigate the contribution of TLRs in recognizing and mediating the inflammatory response to H. pylori, and study the differences in TLRs' performance between H. pylori and E. coli. Specific inhibitors for the declines in TLR2 and TLR4 were also employed. The results showed that H. pylori infection increased TLR2 expression in GES- cells, but TLR4 remained unchanged regardless of H. pylori or TLR2 small interfering RNA treatment. Furthermore, the secretion of cyclooxygenase- (COX-) induced by H. pylori was inhibited by declines in TLR2, but not in TLR4. In conclusion, TLR2 plays an even more important role than TLR4 not only in recognizing H. pylori, but also in the induction of inflammatory cytokines initiated by H. pylori. However, both TLR2 and TLR4 are necessary in mediating the inflammatory response to E. coli LPS.""]",tlr4; tolllike; tlr2; tlrs; tlr5; tlr; myd88; lps; receptor; receptors,tlr4 · tolllike · tlr2

Epigenetic changes during the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) play a significant role. Along with factors such as diet, lifestyle, and genetics, oncogenic infection, bacteria alone or whole microbiome, has been associated with this tumor type. How gut microbiome contributes to CRC pathogenesis in the host is not fully understood. Most of the epigenetic studies in CRC have been conducted in populations infected with Helicobacter pylori. In the current review, we summarize how the gut microbiota contributes in colon carcinogenesis and the potential role of epigenetic mechanism in gene regulation. We discuss microbiota-mediated initiation and progression of colon tumorigenesis and have also touched upon the role of microbial metabolites as an initiator or an inhibitor for procarcinogenic or antioncogenic activities.

In the multifaceted processes of colonic carcinogenesis, gradual alteration of microbiota along with their microenvironment and the potential oncopathogenic microbes mediated modulation of cancer therapy and other factors involved in microbiome dysbiosis leading to the CRC have also been discussed. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the mechanisms of CRC development, the role of microbiome or single bacterial infection in regulating the processes of carcinogenesis, and the intervention by novel therapeutics. Epigenetic mechanism involved in CRC is also discussed.', '[The Power of the Gut Microbiome: Exploring New Perspectives in Colorectal Cancer Therapy].. The gut microbiome is involved in host physiology, including nutrition, metabolism, and immunity. It was recently known that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been implicated in several human diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. It is altered by environmental factors such as diet, habit and lifestyle and has been directly and indirectly linked to the development and progression of colorectal cancer(CRC). Fusobacterium(F.)nucleatum, which causes periodontal disease, has been shown to play an important role in the initiation and development of CRC, although not as clearly as Helicobacter(H.) pylori in gastric cancer. Therefore, gut bacteria hold promise as a potential therapeutic approach to prevent or treat CRC. Although its clinical usefulness has not yet been demonstrated, future research such as metagenomics may open new avenues for CRC treatment with gut bacteria. Here, we reviewed the role of the gut microbial community in the development, progression, and prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis.', 'Host-Gut Microbiota Metabolic Interactions and Their Role in Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Gastrointestinal Cancers.. The critical role of the gut microbiome in gastrointestinal cancers is becoming increasingly clear. Imbalances in the gut microbial community, referred to as dysbiosis, are linked to increased risks for various forms of gastrointestinal cancers. Pathogens like Fusobacterium and Helicobacter pylori relate to the onset of esophageal and gastric cancers, respectively, while microbes such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Clostridium species have been associated with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer. In colorectal cancer, bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum are known to stimulate the growth of tumor cells and trigger cancer-promoting pathways. On the other hand, beneficial microbes like Bifidobacteria offer a protective effect, potentially inhibiting the development of gastrointestinal cancers. The potential for therapeutic interventions that manipulate the gut microbiome is substantial, including strategies to engineer anti-tumor metabolites and employ microbiota-based treatments. Despite the progress in understanding the influence of the microbiome on gastrointestinal cancers, significant challenges remain in identifying and understanding the precise contributions of specific microbial species and their metabolic products. This knowledge is essential for leveraging the role of the gut microbiome in the development of precise diagnostics and targeted therapies for gastrointestinal cancers.']",microbiome; nucleatum; cancer; microbiota; gut; colorectal; crc; cancers; microbial; fusobacterium,microbiome · nucleatum · cancer

CONCLUSION: The -day vonoprazan and low-dose amoxicillin dual therapy provided acceptable H. pylori eradication rates and a similar effect to vonoprazan-based triple therapy in regions with high clarithromycin resistance. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000034140.', 'Vonoprazan and amoxicillin dual therapy as the first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis.. BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of vonoprazan-amoxicillin (VA) dual therapy as the first-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection in different regions with inconsistent results reported. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of VA dual therapy compared to the currently recommended therapy for eradicating H. pylori. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases was performed using the following search terms: (""Helicobacter"" OR ""H. pylori"" OR ""Hp"") AND (""vonoprazan"" OR ""potassium-competitive acid blocker"" OR ""P-CAB"") AND (""amoxicillin"" OR ""penicillin"") AND (""dual""). The primary outcome was to evaluate the eradication rate according to intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. The secondary outcomes were adverse events and compliance. RESULTS: A total of studies involving , patients were included. The pooled eradication rate of VA dual therapy was % and % by intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis, respectively. The adverse events rate and compliance of VA dual therapy were % and %, respectively. The efficacy of VA dual therapy was superior to proton pump inhibitors-based triple therapy (% vs. %, p < ) but lower than vonoprazan-containing quadruple therapy (% vs. %, p = ). -day VA dual therapy showed lower eradication rates than -day (χ2 = , p < ) and -day VA dual therapy (χ2 = , p < ). The adverse events rate of VA dual therapy was lower than vonoprazan triple therapy (% vs. %, p = ) and bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (% vs. %, p < ). No significant difference of compliance was observed between VA dual therapy and each subgroup. CONCLUSION: VA dual therapy, a novel regimen, showed high efficacy as the first-line treatment for H. pylori eradication, which should be optimized before application in different regions.']",dual; va; vonoprazan; therapy; amoxicillin; vonoprazanamoxicillin; mg; eradication; adverse; day,dual · vonoprazan · therapy

BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate Helicobacter pylori eradication impact on the gastric carcinogenesis cascade following the evolution of intestinal metaplasia (IM) in gastric antrum after Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication. METHODS: We followed yearly for a year period after bacterial eradication, HP positive patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers who showed antral gastric intestinal metaplasia at histology at time . All patients, eradicated by OAC triple short-term therapy and assessed both performing 13C-UBT month after eradication and by Giemsa stain, persisted HP negative during follow-up. Upper endoscopy with biopsies from gastric antrum at least cm away from pylorus, was repeated every year in each patient involved in the study, in order to evaluate IM evolution and HP eradication persistence. During the follow-up histological specimens were examinated from the same pathologist and IM differentiated as complete (type I), incomplete (type II) or incomplete solphomucin-positive (type III).

Objectives. Gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM) is frequently encountered and is considered a precursor of gastric adenocarcinoma. In the Van region of Turkey, gastric adenocarcinoma incidence is high but the prevalence of gastric IM is not known. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a main factor leading to atrophy, IM, and cancer development in the stomach. The aim of the current study was to investigate the prevalence of IM and its subtypes and the prevalence of H. pylori infection, atrophy, dysplasia, and cancer in gastric IM subtypes. Materials and Methods. This retrospective study was conducted on IM among the consecutive patients who were undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy between June and October . Clinical records and endoscopic and histopathologic reports of patients with IM were analyzed. Results. The prevalence of gastric IM was %. The prevalence of incomplete IM was statistically significantly higher than complete IM. Type III IM was the most frequent subtype. Conclusions. Gastric IM is a common finding in patients undergoing EGD with biopsy in this region. High prevalence of incomplete type IM, especially type III, can be associated with the high prevalence of gastric cancer in our region.', ""Predictors for development of complete and incomplete intestinal metaplasia (IM) associated with H. pylori infection: A large-scale study from low prevalence area of gastric cancer (IM-HP trial)..

During months of study, there were patients (%) diagnosed with gastric cancer and -year survival rate was only %. CONCLUSIONS: Males, age > years, and current H. pylori infection are significant predictors for the presence of intestinal metaplasia. BMI might be beneficial for using as a predictive risk factor to reduce the development of incomplete intestinal metaplasia.

BACKGROUND: The proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based -day triple therapy is the regimen with the highest cure rates for eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection and has been recommended as the first-line regimen in the world. It had been reported that a -day quadruple therapy could also successfully cure % of the H. pylori infected patients. OBJECTIVES: To observe the efficacy of -day high-dose quadruple therapy versus -day triple therapy for treatment of H. pylori infection, and to observe side-effects of the two different regimens. METHODS: This randomized, open, parallel-controlled study was conducted at Renji Hospital between November to March . A total of consecutive patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia, who were H. pylori positive proven by both rapid urease test and histology were included and randomly assigned to -day quadruple therapy or -day triple therapy. Thirty-nine patients were administered with -day high-dose quadruple therapy including esomeprazole mg b.i.d., colloidal bismuth subcitrate mg q.i.d., amoxicillin g q.i.d. and metronidazole ( mg q.i.d.) for day. Forty-one patients received a standard -day triple therapy consisting of esomeprazole mg b.i.d., clarithromycin mg b.i.d. and amoxicillin g b.i.d. for days.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of quadruple therapy containing doxycycline and routine quadruple therapy for Helicobacter (H.) pylori rescue eradication in patients who had failed the one-week triple therapy. METHODS: Patients who failed the first-line eradication therapy were allocated into two groups. Group A patients (n = ) were administered esomeprazole mg, bismuth potassium citrate mg, amoxicillin g and doxycycline mg, all bid for ten days, while Group B patients (n = ) were administered esomeprazole mg bid, bismuth potassium citrate mg bid, metronidazole mg bid and tetracycline mg q.6h, for ten days. The results of H. pylori eradication were assessed with 13C urea breath test four weeks after the therapy, and the side effects were recorded. RESULTS: A total of patients (average age years) were enrolled in the study. Successful eradication rate for H. pylori was % in Group A and % in Group B, with no significant difference between the two groups. % (/) of patients from group A and % (/) from group B reported at least one adverse event. The adverse events of all patients disappeared after the therapy ceased. CONCLUSION: Quadruple therapy containing doxycycline is as effective as routine quadruple therapy for H. pylori rescue eradication. The regimen is well tolerated by most patients and causes fewer adverse events than routine quadruple therapy. Hence, it may be recommended as a suitable alternative H. pylori rescue regimen in China.', 'Comparative study of Helicobacter pylori eradication rates with 5-day quadruple ""concomitant"" therapy and 7-day standard triple therapy.. BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown the superiority of concomitant quadruple therapy containing antibiotics over triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection. The aim of this study was to compare concomitant quadruple therapy with standard triple therapy for first-line H. pylori eradication. METHODS: A total of patients with proven H. pylori infection were randomly assigned to one of regimens: amoxicillin mg with clarithromycin mg and lansoprazole mg twice daily for days (triple therapy) or amoxicillin mg with clarithromycin mg, metronidazole mg, and lansoprazole mg twice daily for days (concomitant therapy). The success of eradication was evaluated to weeks after completion of treatment. RESULTS: Eradication rates were % in the triple therapy and % in the concomitant therapy (per protocol), but the difference was not statistically significant. Mild adverse events were more frequently reported in the concomitant-therapy group (%) than in the triple-therapy group (%) (P=). CONCLUSIONS: Five-day quadruple concomitant therapy eradicated H. pylori in over % of patients. Accordingly, concomitant therapy is thought to be a promising alternative to triple therapy as a first-line treatment regimen for H. pylori eradication.']",quadruple; mg; therapy; triple; eradication; group; bismuth; amoxicillin; treatment; days,quadruple · therapy · triple

Gastric cancer (GC) remains a major global health concern, particularly in East Asia, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe, where its incidence and mortality rates are high. Helicobacter pylori infection is the primary cause of GC and leads to carcinogenic progression from nonatrophic gastritis to cancer. Although screening programs have been implemented in high-risk countries, such as Japan and South Korea, comprehensive strategies remain limited globally. This study reviewed the status of GC screening worldwide and prevention strategies in regions with different risks. Various GC screening methods have been developed, including H. pylori serology, serum pepsinogen testing, upper gastrointestinal contrast radiography, and endoscopy. Endoscopic screening has shown superior sensitivity and specificity, reducing GC mortality by up to % in South Korea and demonstrating higher detection rates than upper gastrointestinal contrast radiography and pepsinogen testing. However, cost-effectiveness remains a challenge, particularly in Western countries where the overall GC prevalence is lower. Risk stratification using a combination of H. pylori serology and pepsinogen testing has been adopted in Japan to optimize screening efficiency. Additionally, H. pylori eradication has been recognized as a cost-effective strategy to reduce the incidence of GC with economic benefits demonstrated in Japan and other high-risk regions. In the United States, targeted screening of high-risk immigrant populations has been suggested to enhance cost-effectiveness. GC screening strategies should consider developing epidemiological trends, cost-effectiveness, and risk-based approaches. Future efforts should focus on expanding targeted screening initiatives to high-risk groups to improve early detection and survival rates.', 'Screening for gastric cancer in China: Advances, challenges and visions.. Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the major cancers in China and all over the world. Most GCs are diagnosed at an advanced stage with unfavorable prognosis. Along with some other countries, China has developed the government-funded national screening programs for GC and other major cancers. GC screening has been shown to effectively decrease the incidence of and mortality from GC in countries adopting nationwide screening programs (Japan and Korea) and in studies based on selected Chinese populations. The screening of GC relies mostly on gastroendoscopy, the accuracy, reliability and safety of which have been indicated by previous studies. However, considering its invasive screening approach, requirements on skilled endoscopists and pathologists, and a high cost, developing noninvasive methods to amend endoscopic screening would be highly needed. Numerous studies have examined biomarkers for GC screening and the combination of biomarkers involving pepsinogen, gastrin, and Helicobacter pylori antibodies has been proposed for risk stratification, seeking to narrow down the high-risk populations for further endoscopy. Despite all the achievements of endoscopic screening, evidence on appropriate screening age, intervals for repeated screening, novel biomarkers promoting precision prevention, and health economics need to be accumulated to inform policymakers on endoscopic screening in China. With the guide of Health China Planning Outline, we have golden opportunities to promote prevention and control of GC. In this review, we summarize the characteristics of screening programs in China and other East Asian countries and introduce the past and current approaches and strategies for GC screening, aiming for featuring the latest advances and key challenges, and illustrating future visions of GC screening.', 'Screening and surveillance for gastric cancer in the United States:\xa0Is\xa0it needed?. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although the incidence of gastric cancer in the United States is relatively low, the incidence of gastric cancer is higher than for esophageal cancer, for which clear guidelines for screening and surveillance exist. With the increasing availability of endoscopic therapy, such as endoscopic submucosal dissection, for treating advanced dysplasia and early gastric cancer, establishing guidelines for screening and surveillance of patients who are at high risk of developing gastric cancer has the potential to diagnose and treat gastric cancer at an earlier stage and improve mortality from gastric cancer. The aims of this article were to review the data regarding the risk factors for developing gastric cancer, methods for gastric cancer screening, and results of national screening programs. METHODS: A review of the existing literature related to the aims was performed. RESULTS: Risk factors for gastric cancer that were identified include race/ethnicity (East Asian, Russian, or South American), first-degree relative diagnosed with gastric cancer, positive Helicobacter pylori status, and presence of atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia. Endoscopy has the highest rate of detecting gastric cancer compared with other gastric cancer screening methods. The national screening program in Japan has demonstrated a mortality reduction from gastric cancer based on cohort data. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric cancer screening with endoscopy should be considered in individuals who are immigrants from regions associated with a high risk of gastric cancer (East Asia, Russia, or South America) or who have a family history of gastric cancer. Those with findings of atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia on screening endoscopy should undergo surveillance endoscopy every to years. Large prospective multicenter studies are needed to further identify additional risk factors for developing gastric cancer and to assess whether gastric cancer screening programs for high-risk populations in the United States would result in improved mortality.']",screening; cancer; gc; abc; gastric; highrisk; risk; for; endoscopic; endoscopy,screening · cancer · abc

BACKGROUND: To determine the prevalence of resistance to metronidazole, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, amoxicillin, and furazolidone in Helicobacter pylori isolated from Chinese children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study was conducted from January to December . A total of isolates of H. pylori were collected from nine areas of Zhejiang province in the southeast coastal region of China. H. pylori strains were examined for antibiotics susceptibility by agar dilution method. RESULTS: The resistance rates were % for metronidazole, % for clarithromycin, % for levofloxacin, % for amoxicillin, and % for furazolidone. The pattern of H. pylori antibiotic resistance demonstrated no significant changes in the rates of resistance to clarithromycin, amoxicillin, furazolidone, and metronidazole over years. A significant trend of increasing resistance to metronidazole was observed as children aged, but a downward trend in clarithromycin resistance was observed as children aged. No difference in the resistance to other antibiotics was observed among different age groups. Also, there was no significant difference between male and female subjects in rates of resistance to these five types of antibiotics.

The aim of this study was to compare quadruple and triple furazolidone-based regimens to achieve an economically affordable regimen with acceptable success rate and fewer side effects. METHODS: Patients with Helicobacter pylori positive peptic ulcer disease were randomly allocated into two groups: amoxicillin g b.i.d., furazolidone mg b.i.d. and omeprazole mg b.i.d. with or without bismuth subcitrate mg b.i.d. for two weeks (amoxicillin, furazolidone, omeprazole, bismuth and amoxicillin, furazolidone, omeprazole regimens, respectively). Helicobacter pylori eradication was confirmed by 13C-urea breath test weeks after the end of therapy. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were enrolled, but patients discontinued their therapy or follow-up.

The most frequent adverse effects in the two study groups were weakness, nausea, anorexia, and dizziness, and no significant differences between the groups were shown. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results in this study, furazolidone-based triple therapy (without bismuth) is not recommended for Helicobacter pylori eradication because of the lower eradication rate and unchanged frequency of adverse effects.

METHODS: Patients who failed in the H pylori eradication therapy for at least one course were randomly allocated into three groups. Group A received rebaprazole mg + amoxicillin g + furazolidone mg, and bismuth subcitrate mg, twice daily for wk; group B received the same regimen of group A but for wk; and group C received the same regimen of group B, but furazolidone was replaced by furazolidone mg three times daily. To record the side effect profiles at the end of the treatment, H pylori eradication was assessed with ()C-urea breath test wk after therapy. RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled including males, and patients in each group. The average age of the patients was years, ranging from to years. H pylori eradication rates with per-protocol analysis were %, % and % in the three groups, respectively.

BACKGROUND: Around half of the global population is chronically infected with the stomach bacterium Helicobacter pylori, making it one of the most common chronic infections worldwide. H. pylori induces the production of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and accelerates the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which may lead to cancer development. In this study, we investigated the relationship between H. pylori infection and the expression of p53 in gastric mucosa in a group of patients from Jordan. METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, the epithelium of gastric glands in subjects chronically infected with H. pylori was examined for the expression of p53. Paraffin-embedded gastric biopsy samples from the archives for Jordanian patients diagnosed with chronic H. pylori infection and samples free of H. pylori infection and any other gastric abnormalities were selected. Samples were analyzed for the presence of H. pylori as well as p53 expression levels in the mucosa and submucosa by immunohistochemical analyses and Western blotting. RESULTS: H. pylori was detected in the gastric tissues of infected individuals (n = ); whereas, no H. pylori infection was detected in uninfected healthy individuals (n = ) using immunohistochemistry. In contrast to the noninfected samples of gastric mucosa, no nuclear p53 expression was detected in the infected samples using immunohistochemistry. In addition, the levels of p53 in H. pylori-positive samples detected by Western blotting were significantly lower than those in the negative individuals. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that p53 protein expression decreased in gastric mucosa of patients infected with H. pylori. The loss of this tumor suppressor may play a role in the increased risk for tumor initiation associated with H. pylori carriage.', 'Immunohistochemical evaluation of p53 expression and proliferative activity in children with Helicobacter pylori associated gastritis.. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of p53 expression and proliferative activity of glandular epithelium and intestinal metaplasia in Helicobacter pylori associated gastritis of pediatric patients. METHODS: The study included endoscopic gastric biopsies of children with dyspeptic complaints. Immunohistochemistry was performed for evaluation of p53 expression and Ki- labeling index, an indicator of proliferative activity. Grading of H. pylori density, intestinal metaplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration were performed in histologic tissue sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin, Giemsa and Alcian-blue. RESULTS: Of children, (%) were infected by H. pylori. Positive immunostaining for p53 was observed in of cases (%). H. pylori infection was found in (%) of the p53-positive patients. There was a positive correlation between H. pylori density and Ki- labeling index in H. pylori infected children. H. pylori density, Ki- labeling index and inflammatory cell infiltration in the p53-positive group were significantly higher than in the p53-negative group. Although intestinal metaplasia was more common in H. pylori infected children (n = ; %), there was no difference in the rate of intestinal metaplasia between the p53-positive and p53-negative groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that p53 mutations and higher proliferative activity of glandular epithelium may be related to H. pylori associated gastritis in children. Because p53 mutation does not appear to be associated with intestinal metaplasia, a precursor for gastric cancer in adults, we think that H.pylori associated p53 alterations do not initiate and promote gastric cancer that may occur in adulthood.', 'p53, a potential predictor of Helicobacter pylori infection-associated gastric carcinogenesis?. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is an ancient and persistent inhabitant of the human stomach that is closely linked to the development of gastric cancer (GC). . Emerging evidence suggests that H. pylori strain interactions with gastric epithelial cells subvert the best- characterized p53 tumour suppressor pathway. A high prevalence of p53 mutations is related to H. pylori infection. H. pylori also accelerates p53 protein degradation by disturbing the MDM2-P53 feedback loop.

Metronidazole resistance is an important factor related to failure in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori. The mutation in the rdxA and frxA genes is the most important cause of resistance to metronidazole. Since the resistance rate of metronidazole is high in our region, we decided to assess the frequency of these mutations among H. pylori clinical isolates. Antral gastric biopsy specimens were cultured and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of metronidazole were determined by the E-test method. The rdxA and frxA genes were amplified in all isolates through the use of PCR with the specific primers. PCR products were purified for sequencing. The resultant sequences were compared with the wild type reference sequences to find any possible mutations. According to our findings, the rate of metronidazole resistance was %, with the MICs ranging from - µg/ml for metronidazolesensitive group and from - µg/ml for resistance group. H. pylori isolates containing a single mutation in rdxA or frxA genes demonstrated a low MIC (- µg/ml), while those containing mutations in both genes showed a higher MIC (- µg/ml). In this study, all resistant H. pylori isolates contained single or multiple nucleotide substitutions in the mentioned genes. Nevertheless, no nucleotide substitutions were found in the sensitive clinical isolates. The results of our study showed that the mutations in rdxA are mostly related to metronidazole resistance, and mutations in frxA are able to enhance H. pylori resistance.', 'In vitro induction of resistance to metronidazole, and analysis of mutations in rdxA and frxA genes from Helicobacter pylori isolates.. In clinical Helicobacter pylori isolates, metronidazole resistance has been associated with mutations in the rdxA and frxA genes. The aim of this study was to examine the role of the rdxA and frxA genes after the in vitro induction of metronidazole resistance. A total of five suscep-tible H. pylori isolates were initially exposed to different subinhibitory metronidazole concentrations to induce in vitro resistance to metronidazole. Susceptible and resistant strains after the in vitro induction of resistance were examined to evaluate mutations of the rdxA and frxA genes by sequence analysis. After the in vitro induction of resistance, analysis revealed that two and four susceptible strains developed resistance when cultured with microg/ml and microg/ml of metronidazole, respectively. Before and after the induction of resistance, none of the susceptible strains that developed low and moderate levels of resistance presented any mutation in either of the evaluated genes, whereas strains with high-level metronidazole resistance contained a simple mutation of the frxA gene, but no specific changes in the rdxA gene. Strains with moderate-level resistance contained both single and multiple mutations of rdxA and frxA, respectively, and the low-level-metronidazole-resistant strain contained a single mutation in the frxA gene, without any significant change in the rdxA gene. In this study, the strains that developed resistance were mainly associated with mutations of the frxA gene, suggesting the possibility that inactivation of this gene could originate metronidazole resistance. The results after the in vitro induction of resistance to metronidazole suggested the presence of additional metronidazole resistance mechanisms, other than mutations of the rdxA and/or frxA genes.']",rdxa; frxa; metronidazole; mutations; resistance; mtz; isolates; mutation; genes; resistant,rdxa · frxa · metronidazole

Rosacea is a chronic skin disease characterized by facial erythema and telangiectasia. Despite the fact that many hypotheses have been proposed, its etiology remains unknown. In the present review, the possible link and clinical significance of Helicobacter pylori in the pathogenesis of rosacea are being sought. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was performed using the terms ""rosacea"", ""H.pylori"", ""gastrointestinal disorders and H.pylori"", ""microorganisms and rosacea"", ""pathogenesis and treatment of rosacea"", and ""risk factors of rosacea"", and selected publications were studied and referenced in text. Although a possible pathogenetic link between H. pylori and rosacea is advocated by many authors, evidence is still interpreted differently by others. We conclude that further studies are needed in order to fully elucidate the pathogenesis of rosacea.', 'Relationship between Helicobacter pylori and Rosacea: review and discussion.. BACKGROUND: Rosacea is an inflammatory disease affecting the central part of face characterized by persistent or recurrent episodes of erythema, papules, pustules and telangiectasias of unknown etiology. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative bacillus, which is one of the main causes of chronic gastritis, gastric cancer and gastrointestinal ulcers. Recent evidences have suggested that H. pylori infection is closely related to the occurrence of diseases. In recent years, studies have found that Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with the occurrence of acne rosacea. So the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection may be a therapeutic method of acne rosacea. But it continues to be controversial. In other studies, the treatment of Helicobacter pylori did not significantly reduce the severity of acne rosacea. To further explore the association between acne rosacea and Helicobacter pylori infection, a summarize method was used to study the relationship between acne rosacea and Helicobacter pylori, providing reference for clinical acne rosacea therapy. METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted on Wanfang Data, CQVIP, Springer, Public Health Management Corporation (PHMC), CNKI, and Pubmed, from January , to Mar. , , using Helicobacter pylori and rosacea to retrieve the literature. Depending on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, articles considered or confirmed the correlation between H. pylori and rosacea. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations and experiments have confirmed that H. pylori infection is associated with the development of rosacea. The effect of anti-H. pylori therapy is better than the routine therapy for rosacea. H. pylori can stimulate the immune system to produce a large number of inflammatory mediators, leading to the occurrence and aggravation of rosacea inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: It is confirmed that H. pylori infection is involved in the development of rosacea. It is suggested that rosacea patients should be tested for H. pylori infection, the H. pylori-positive rosacea patients should be treated with eradication of H. pylori, so as to enhance the therapeutic effect of rosacea. This study adds that H. pylori infection is involved in the development of rosacea. Epidemiological investigations and experiments have confirmed the rationality. The effect of anti-H. pylori therapy is better than the routine therapy for rosacea. H. pylori-positive rosacea patients should be treated with the therapeutic method of eradication of H. pylori.', '[THE ROLE OF HELICOBACTER PYLORI IN ROSACEA AND PATHOGENETIC TREATMENT].. Rosacea is a chronic, recurrent skin disease. It may be aggravated by various factors. An increased incidence of rosacea has been reported in those who carry the stomach bacterium Helicobacter pylori. The purpose of this study was determination of the relationship of this infection with rosacea and to investigate effectiveness of eradication therapy of H. pylori. As our results showed, % of study patients were infected with H. pillory. There was correlation between infection rates and rosacea severity. In most cases the positive test results for H.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Despite advances in management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, mortality is still %. This study aimed to identify predictive factors and to develop a prediction model for mortality among patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. METHODS: Consecutive patients with endoscopic stigmata of active bleeding, visible vessels, or adherent clots were recruited, and risk factors for mortality were identified in this deprivation cohort by using multiple stepwise logistic regression. A prediction model was then built on the basis of these factors and validated in the evaluation cohort. RESULTS: From to , patients with bleeding peptic ulcers were treated.

Peptic ulcer bleeding is a frequent and dramatic event with both a high mortality rate and a substantial cost for healthcare systems worldwide. It has been found that age is an independent predisposing factor for gastrointestinal bleeding, with the risk increasing significantly in individuals aged> years and increasing further in those aged> years. Indeed, bleeding incidence and mortality are distinctly higher in elderly patients, especially in those with co-morbidities. NSAID therapy and Helicobacter pylori infection are the most prevalent aetiopathogenetic factors involved in peptic ulcer bleeding. The risk of bleeding seems to be higher for NSAID- than for H. pylori-related ulcers, most likely because the antiplatelet action of NSAIDs impairs the clotting process. NSAID users may be classified as low or high risk, according to the absence or presence of one or more of the following factors associated with an increased risk of bleeding: co-morbidities; corticosteroid or anticoagulant co-therapy; previous dyspepsia, peptic ulcer or ulcer bleeding; and alcohol consumption. Different types of NSAIDs have been associated with different bleeding risk, but no anti-inflammatory drug, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX)- inhibitors, is completely safe for the stomach. Furthermore, even low-dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) [< mg/day] and a standard dose of non-aspirin antiplatelet treatment (clopidogrel or ticlopidine) have been found to cause bleeding and mortality. No clear risk factor favouring H. pylori-related ulcer bleeding has been identified. Peptic ulcer bleeding prevention remains a challenge for the physician, but data are now available on use of a safer and cheaper strategy for both low- and high-risk patients. Unfortunately, despite the fact that several society and national guidelines have been formulated, these are poorly followed in clinical practice. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or misoprostol therapy and H. pylori eradication in NSAID-naive patients are the most commonly proposed strategies. Selective COX- inhibitor therapy in high-risk patients has also been suggested, but concerns over the possible cardiovascular adverse effects of some of these agents should be taken into account. Moreover, switching to selective COX- inhibitors in patients with previous bleeding is not completely risk free, and concomitant PPI therapy is also needed. H. pylori eradication is mandatory in all patients with peptic ulcer, and such an approach has been found to be significantly superior to PPI maintenance therapy. H. pylori eradication is frequently achieved with sequential therapy in elderly patients with peptic ulcer. In conclusion, upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a dramatic event with a high mortality rate, particularly in the elderly. Some effective preventative strategies are now available that should be implemented in clinical practice.']",bleeding; ulcer; rebleeding; peptic; pub; mortality; ulcers; endoscopic; patients; upper,bleeding · ulcer · rebleeding

Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide. Early detection of precancerous conditions-atrophic gastritis (AG), intestinal metaplasia (IM), and dysplasia-is vital for surveillance. Objectives: To assess the accuracy of single high-quality endoscopy (HQE) in detecting advanced GPCs and to identify risk factors for AG, IM, and dysplasia. Methods: A retrospective review of gastroscopies (-) at a single center. Endoscopic findings were compared with histology, including OLGA/OLGIM staging, dysplasia, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) status. Results: The study population comprised women (%) and men (%), with a mean age of years (SD: ).

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The prevalence of precursor lesions for gastric cancer (GC) and the differential burden between countries of varying GC risk is not well-understood. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the global prevalence of precursor lesions. METHODS: We estimated the prevalence of atrophic gastritis (AG), gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM), and dysplasia in regions with low, medium, and high GC incidence. Because IM is an advanced manifestation of AG, we assessed the prevalence of less advanced precursors, regardless of the presence of more advanced lesions. Prevalence was sub-stratified by Helicobacter pylori infection, symptomatology, and period (<, -, and >). RESULTS: Among the articles that underwent full-text review, studies met inclusion criteria. The global prevalence estimates of AG, IM, and dysplasia were %, %, and %, respectively, on the basis of studies that reported the prevalence of less advanced precursors, regardless of the presence of more advanced lesions. The prevalence of all precursor lesions was higher in high and medium compared with low GC incidence countries (P < .). Prevalence of AG and IM was significantly higher among H pylori-infected individuals (P < .) but not statistically different between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (P > .). All precursors demonstrated a secular decrease in prevalence over time. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric precursor lesions have differences in prevalence in regions with differential GC incidence and are associated with H pylori infection. Because of the substantial prevalence of precursor lesions in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, symptomatic evaluation may not be sufficient to identify individuals at risk. These estimates provide important insights for tailoring GC prevention strategies.', 'Epidemiology of premalignant gastric lesions: implications for the development of screening and surveillance strategies.. Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide; however, gastric cancer incidence varies greatly between different geographic areas. As gastric cancer is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, the disease causes considerable morbidity and mortality. To detect gastric carcinomas at an early and curable stage, screening and surveillance seem necessary. Premalignant gastric lesions are well known risk factors for the development of intestinal type gastric adenocarcinomas. In a multistep cascade, chronic Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis progresses through premalignant stages of atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia, to eventually gastric cancer. Therefore, this cascade may provide a basis for early detection and treatment of gastric cancer. Epidemiology of gastric cancer and premalignant gastric lesions should guide the development of screening and surveillance strategies, as distinct approaches are required in countries with low and high gastric cancer incidences.']",lesions; precancerous; dysplasia; premalignant; gastric; surveillance; metaplasia; endoscopic; cancer; intestinal,lesions · precancerous · dysplasia

Transcription of both chromosomal and extrachromosomally introduced nifS was regulated (up-expressed) by oxygen or by supplemental iron conditions. This up-expression was not observed in a fur mutant strain background or when an iron chelator was added. Iron-bound Fur (but not apo-Fur) recognized the nifS promoter, and Fur bound significantly farther upstream (- bp to - bp and - to - bp) in the promoter than documented Helicobacter pylori Fur binding regions. This binding was stronger than Fur recognition of the flgE or napA promoter and includes a Fur recognition sequence common to the H. pylori pfr and sodB upstream areas. Studies of Fur-regulated genes in H. pylori have indicated that apo-Fur acts as a repressor, but our results demonstrate that iron-bound Fur activates (nifS) transcription.', 'Iron-responsive regulation of the Helicobacter pylori iron-cofactored superoxide dismutase SodB is mediated by Fur.. Maintaining iron homeostasis is a necessity for all living organisms, as free iron augments the generation of reactive oxygen species like superoxide anions, at the risk of subsequent lethal cellular damage. The iron-responsive regulator Fur controls iron metabolism in many bacteria, including the important human pathogen Helicobacter pylori, and thus is directly or indirectly involved in regulation of oxidative stress defense. Here we demonstrate that Fur is a direct regulator of the H. pylori iron-cofactored superoxide dismutase SodB, which is essential for the defense against toxic superoxide radicals. Transcription of the sodB gene was iron induced in H. pylori wild-type strain , resulting in expression of the SodB protein in iron-replete conditions but an absence of expression in iron-restricted conditions. Mutation of the fur gene resulted in constitutive, iron-independent expression of SodB. Recombinant H. pylori Fur protein bound with low affinity to the sodB promoter region, but addition of the iron substitute Mn2+ abolished binding. The operator sequence of the iron-free form of Fur, as identified by DNase I footprinting, was located directly upstream of the sodB gene at positions - to - from the transcription start site. The direct role of Fur in regulation of the H. pylori sodB gene contrasts with the small-RNA-mediated sodB regulation observed in Escherichia coli. In conclusion, H. pylori Fur is a versatile regulator involved in many pathways essential for gastric colonization, including superoxide stress defense.', 'Transcriptional profiling of Helicobacter pylori Fur- and iron-regulated gene expression.. Intracellular iron homeostasis is a necessity for almost all living organisms, since both iron restriction and iron overload can result in cell death. The ferric uptake regulator protein, Fur, controls iron homeostasis in most Gram-negative bacteria. In the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, Fur is thought to have acquired extra functions to compensate for the relative paucity of regulatory genes. To identify H. pylori genes regulated by iron and Fur, we used DNA array-based transcriptional profiling with RNA isolated from H. pylori wild-type and fur mutant cells grown in iron-restricted and iron-replete conditions. Sixteen genes encoding proteins involved in metal metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, motility, cell wall synthesis and cofactor synthesis displayed iron-dependent Fur-repressed expression. Conversely, genes encoding proteins involved in iron storage, respiration, energy metabolism, chemotaxis, and oxygen scavenging displayed iron-induced Fur-dependent expression. Several Fur-regulated genes have been previously shown to be essential for acid resistance or gastric colonization in animal models, such as those encoding the hydrogenase and superoxide dismutase enzymes. Overall, there was a partial overlap between the sets of genes regulated by Fur and those previously identified as growth-phase, iron or acid regulated. Regulatory patterns were confirmed for five selected genes using Northern hybridization. In conclusion, H. pylori Fur is a versatile regulator involved in many pathways essential for gastric colonization. These findings further delineate the central role of Fur in regulating the unique capacity of H. pylori to colonize the human stomach.']",fur; iron; sodb; regulator; uptake; ferric; regulation; napa; proteins; protein,fur · iron · sodb

We describe the first pediatric case of an eosinophilic duodenal ulcer with esophageal involvement that was effectively treated using proton pump inhibitor monotherapy. A -year-old boy with no relevant family or medical history presented with a one-month history of epigastric pain. Laboratory test results were as follows: white blood cell count, ,/µL; eosinophil count, /µL (%); and total IgE, IU/L; and IgG antibodies for Helicobacter pylori were absent. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed longitudinal linear furrows in the esophagus, indicating eosinophilic esophagitis with an A1 ulcer from the duodenal bulb to the descending duodenum. The patient was diagnosed with an eosinophilic duodenal ulcer with esophageal involvement based on pathological findings. Esomeprazole, a common proton pump inhibitor, was orally administered, after which the symptoms promptly improved. After two months, the esophagogastroduodenoscopy and pathological examination results showed improvement in both the esophagus and duodenum. There have been no previous reports of an eosinophilic duodenal ulcer with esophageal involvement without post-duodenal involvement at the time of diagnosis.

Basic knowledge of these diseases has mainly come from studies of EoE and Th2 type allergic reactions, including IL-, IL-, and IL-, thymic stromal protein, and eotaxin , which are considered to have important roles. For a diagnosis of EoE, endoscopic abnormalities and histological confirmation of dense eosinophile infiltration in the esophageal epithelial layer are important, in addition to identifying dysphagia symptoms.

Helicobacter pylori infection is highly prevalent in the human population, yet relatively few infected individuals progress to severe forms of disease, such as peptic ulcers and stomach cancer. The severity of disease outcomes to H. pylori infection is, in large part, determined by inflammatory and cellular responses within the gastric niche that, in turn, are the product of various host, bacterial, and environmental factors. It is now clear that the innate immune system, representing the first line of host defense against infection and other foreign aggressions, is critical to the initiation of the immune responses and inflammation observed in H. pylori infection. We propose that by investigating the activation of innate immune signaling pathways and downstream responses, it is possible to better understand the link between Helicobacter infection and the development of severe disease. Here, we describe tools that have been developed to investigate host innate immune responses to Helicobacter infection.', ""Immune responses to Helicobacter pylori colonization: mechanisms and clinical outcomes.. Helicobacter pylori colonizes the stomachs of half of the world's population and usually persists in the gastric mucosa of human hosts for decades or life. Although most H. pylori-positive people are asymptomatic, the presence of H. pylori is associated with increased risk for the development of peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric lymphoma. The development of a sustained gastric inflammatory and immune response to infection appears to be pivotal for the development of disease. During its long co-existence with humans, H. pylori has evolved complex strategies to maintain a mild inflammation of the gastric epithelium while limiting the extent of immune effector activity. In this review, the nature of the host immune response to H. pylori infection and the mechanism employed by the bacterium to evade them is considered.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a bacterial pathogen that resides in more than half of the human population and has co-evolved with humans for more than , years. This bacterium is orally transmitted during childhood and is a key cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers and two malignant cancers including MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma and adenocarcinoma. Despite the strong innate and adaptive immune responses, H. pylori has a long-term survival in the gastric mucosa. In addition to the virulence factors, survival of H. pylori is strongly influenced by the ability of bacteria to escape, disrupt and manipulate the host immune system. This bacterium can escape from recognition by innate immune receptors via altering its surface molecules. Moreover, H. pylori subverts adaptive immune response by modulation of effector T cell. In this review, we discuss the immune-pathogenicity of H. pylori by focusing on its ability to manipulate the innate and acquired immune responses to increase its survival in the gastric mucosa, leading up to gastrointestinal disorders. We also highlight the mechanisms that resulted to the persistence of H. pylori in gastric mucosa.']",immune; innate; responses; response; macrophages; host; cells; immunity; mice; inflammatory,immune · innate · responses

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In all, HIV+ patients and age- and sex-matched HIV- controls, all with upper GI symptoms, were evaluated by an upper endoscopy examination and gastric biopsy. H. pylori status was assessed with a urease test and histology. HIV was diagnosed with the rapid test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The prevalence of H. pylori was % (/ [%CI -]) in HIV+ subjects and % (/ [%CI -]) in HIV- controls (p = ). H. pylori infection rates did not differ significantly in HIV+ patients between those with a CD4 count ≥/mm3 (%) and those with a CD4 count </mm3 (%) (p = ).

BACKGROUND: This study conducted in Northeastern Brazil, evaluated the prevalence of H. pylori infection and the presence of gastritis in HIV-infected patients. METHODS: There were included HIV-positive and age-matched HIV-negative patients, who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for dyspeptic symptoms. H. pylori status was evaluated by urease test and histology. RESULTS: The prevalence of H. pylori infection was significantly lower (p < ) in HIV-infected (%) than in uninfected (%) patients. There were no significant differences between H. pylori status and gender, age, HIV viral load, antiretroviral therapy and the use of antibiotics. A lower prevalence of H. pylori was observed among patients with T CD4 cell count below /mm3; however, it was not significant.

BACKGROUND: There is a widespread co-infection of HIV and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) globally, particularly in developing countries, and it has been suggested that this co-infection may affect the course of HIV disease. However, the interplay between H. pylori infection and HIV disease progression is not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effect of H. pylori co-infection on CD4+ T cell count and HIV viral load dynamics in HIV-positive individuals in a high co-endemic setting. METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals, both with and without H. pylori infection. Among HIV-positive participants, were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and were ART-naïve. CD4+ T cell count and HIV- viral load were measured and compared between H. pylori-infected and -uninfected individuals, taking into account different HIV and ART status. RESULT: Our study demonstrated that individuals infected with H. pylori had a significantly higher CD4+ T cell count compared to uninfected controls among both HIV-negative and HIV-positive participants, regardless of ART therapy. Conversely, HIV/H. pylori co-infected participants had lower HIV- viral load than those without H. pylori infection. Linear regression analysis further confirmed a positive association between H. pylori infection, along with other clinical factors such as BMI, ART, and duration of therapy, with CD4+ T cell count while indicating an inverse relationship with HIV- viral load in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, factors such as khat chewing, age and WHO clinical stage of HIV were associated with reduced CD4+ T cell count and increased HIV- viral load. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that H. pylori co-infection was associated with higher CD4+ T cell count and lower HIV- viral load in HIV-positive patients, regardless of ART status. These findings show a positive effect of H. pylori co-infection on the dynamics of HIV-related immunological and virological parameters.

The role of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in patients following endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer (EGC) remains unclear. This article presents a review of literature published in the past years. H. pylori-mediated persistent methylation levels are associated with the development of metachronous gastric cancer. The methylation of certain specific genes can be used to identify patients with a high risk of metachronous gastric cancer even after H. pylori eradication. H. pylori eradication after endoscopic resection should be performed as early as possible for eradication success and prevention of metachronous precancerous lesions. Although whether the eradication of H. pylori could prevent the development of metachronous cancer after endoscopic resection is controversial, several meta-analyses concluded that H. pylori eradication could reduce the incidence of metachronous gastric cancer significantly. In addition, H. pylori eradication in gastric cancer survivors after endoscopic resection could reduce healthcare cost and save lives in a cost-effective way. Taken together, H. pylori eradication after endoscopic resection of EGC is recommended as prevention for metachronous precancerous lesions and metachronous gastric cancer.', 'Failure of Helicobacter pylori eradication and age are independent risk factors for recurrent neoplasia after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer in 283 patients..

BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) is nowadays an established bariatric procedure. Although preoperative gastroscopy is recommended to rule out severe pathologies, there is little evidence about the role of routine histopathologic examination of resected specimens. We sought to identify the prevalence of histopathological relevant findings in patients undergoing LSG and to evaluate their impact in clinical practice. METHODS: A retrospective analysis on a prospectively collected dataset on patients undergoing LSG between August and May in two bariatric centers was performed. Demographic and clinical data and histopathological results were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixhundred-thrirteen patients were identified, mean age was years (-), average body mass index was kg/m2 (-). Histopathology revealed abnormal findings in % of the patients, most common pathology was chronic non-active or minimally to moderate active gastritis (n = ;%). Among others, Helicobacter-associated gastritis (n = ;%), intestinal metaplasia (n = ;%), micronodular enterochromaffine-like cell hyperplasia (n = ; %) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (n = ; %) were present.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancer types worldwide. In China, gastric cancer has become one of the major threats for public health, ranking second on incidence and third on cause of cancer death. Despite the common risk factors that promote the development of gastric cancer, the huge quantity of microorganism colonies within the gastrointestinal tract, particularly Helicobacter pylori infection, demonstrates a correlation with chronic inflammation and gastric carcinogenesis, as epidemiological studies have determined that H. pylori infection confers approximately % of the attributable risk for gastric cancer. SUMMARY: The current article draws an overview on the correlation between the microbiota, inflammation and gastric tumorigenesis. H. pylori infection has been identified as the main risk factor as it triggers epithelial barrier disruption, survival signaling as well as genetic/epigenetic modulation. Apart from H. pylori, the existence of a diverse and complex composition of microbiota in the stomach has been identified, which supports a role of microbiota in the development of gastric cancer. Moreover, metagenomics studies focused on the composition and function of the microbiota have associated microbiota with gastric metabolic diseases and even tumorigenesis. Apart from the gastric microbiota, inflammation is another identified contributor to cancer development as well. KEY MESSAGE: Though H. pylori infection and the non-H. pylori microbiota play a role in gastric cancer, the properties of gastric microbiota and mechanisms by which they participate in the genesis of gastric cancer are still not clearly depicted. Moreover, it remains to be understood how the presence of microbiota along with H. pylori infection affects the progress from gastric disease to cancer. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This article summarized a clue of the current studies on microbiota, H. pylori infection and the progression from gastric disease to cancer.', 'Effect of Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric cancer on gastrointestinal microbiota: a narrative review.. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a typical microbial agent that interferes with the complex mechanisms of gastric homeostasis by disrupting the balance between the host gastric microbiota and mucosa-related factors, ultimately leading to inflammatory changes, dysbiosis, and gastric cancer (GC). We searched this field on the basis of PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Most studies show that H. pylori inhibits the colonization of other bacteria, resulting in a less variety of bacteria in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. When comparing the patients with H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative GC, the composition of the gastric microbiome changes with increasing abundance of H. pylori (where present) in the gastritis stage, whereas, as the gastric carcinogenesis cascade progresses to GC, oral and intestinal-type pathogenic microbial strains predominate. H. pylori infection induces a premalignant milieu of atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, and the resulting change in gastric microbiota appears to play an important role in gastric carcinogenesis. The effect of H. pylori-induced GC on GI microbiota is discussed in this review.', 'Helicobacter pylori, gastric microbiota and gastric cancer relationship: Unrolling the tangle.. Helicobacter pylori infection (Hp-I) represents a typical microbial agent intervening in the complex mechanisms of gastric homeostasis by disturbing the balance between the host gastric microbiota and mucosa-related factors, leading to inflammatory changes, dysbiosis and eventually gastric cancer. The normal gastric microbiota shows diversity, with Proteobacteria [Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) belongs to this family], Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroides and Fusobacteria being the most abundant phyla. Most studies indicate that H. pylori has inhibitory effects on the colonization of other bacteria, harboring a lower diversity of them in the stomach. When comparing the healthy with the diseased stomach, there is a change in the composition of the gastric microbiome with increasing abundance of H. pylori (where present) in the gastritis stage, while as the gastric carcinogenesis cascade progresses to gastric cancer, the oral and intestinal-type pathogenic microbial strains predominate. Hp-I creates a premalignant environment of atrophy and intestinal metaplasia and the subsequent alteration in gastric microbiota seems to play a crucial role in gastric tumorigenesis itself. Successful H. pylori eradication is suggested to restore gastric microbiota, at least in primary stages. It is more than clear that Hp-I, gastric microbiota and gastric cancer constitute a challenging tangle and the strong interaction between them makes it difficult to unroll. Future studies are considered of crucial importance to test the complex interaction on the modulation of the gastric microbiota by H. pylori as well as on the relationships between the gastric microbiota and gastric carcinogenesis.']",microbiota; microbial; carcinogenesis; gastric; gc; microbiome; cancer; diversity; dysbiosis; bacteria,microbiota · microbial · carcinogenesis

Since the discovery of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), numerous studies have considered the possibility that it plays a role in different extragastric diseases. Most of these studies may be classified as epidemiological studies or investigations of H. pylori eradication, but there are also case reports and in vitro studies. This review reveals the limitations common to most of them. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is the disease for which the strongest association with H. pylori infection has been shown. Data are also accumulating about the role of H. pylori infection in idiopathic iron deficiency anemia and chronic idiopathic urticaria. Interesting results show that H. pylori infection affects atherosclerosis and is weakly associated with ischemic heart disease and stroke. Moreover, CagA-positive H. pylori strains may play a role in the natural history of atherosclerotic stroke. Recent studies suggest a link between H. pylori and Parkinson's disease. Preliminary data indicate that H. pylori infection impairs gastric ghrelin production and may influence nutritional status. The association between H. pylori infection and other extragastric diseases remains controversial. H. pylori infection may cause extragastric manifestations directly or indirectly, by various mechanisms including atrophic gastritis, the release of inflammatory mediators, molecular mimicry, and systemic immune response. Evidence suggests that anti-H. pylori therapy improves idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (significant increase of platelet count in half of the cases), iron-deficiency anemia, and chronic urticaria (% remission rate), but the data from randomized controlled trials are insufficient to confirm these positive effects."", 'Review: Helicobacter pylori and extragastric diseases.. In the last year, many studies have demonstrated a potential role of Helicobacter pylori in the pathogenic mechanisms of different extragastric diseases. While the role of H pylori in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic iron deficiency anemia, and vitamin B12 deficiency has already been demonstrated, there is growing evidence of other related conditions, especially cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurologic disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. A summary of the results of the most relevant studies published over the last year on this attractive topic is presented in this review.', 'Extragastric manifestations of Helicobacter pylori infection -- other Helicobacters.. Today there is evidence that Helicobacter pylori has a critical role in different extragastric diseases. The discovery of a number of other novel Helicobacter species has stimulated the research in different extragastric diseases, in which an infectious hypothesis is plausible. Enterohepatic Helicobacter species have been hypothesized to play a role in different disorders, including hepatocellular carcinoma, gallstones formation and cholangiocellular carcinoma, as well as enteric diseases and inflammatory bowel diseases. Concerning the extragastric manifestations of H. pylori infection, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and sideropenic anemia represent, based on the current data, the diseases in which the pathogenic link appears to be strongest.

This paper describes genetic investigations of seroreactivity to five common infectious pathogens in the Genetics of Coronary Artery Disease in Alaska Natives (GOCADAN) study. Antibody titers and seroprevalence were available for to (depending on the phenotype) family members at two time points, approximately years apart, for Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV-), and herpes simplex virus (HSV-). Seroprevalence rates indicate that infections with most of these pathogens are common (≥% for all of them, >% for H. pylori, CMV, and HSV-). Seropositive individuals typically remain seropositive over time, with seroreversion rates of <% to % over ∼ years. Antibody titers were significantly heritable for most pathogens, with the highest estimate being for C. pneumoniae. Significant genome-wide linkage evidence was obtained for C. pneumoniae on chromosome (logarithm of odds, LOD score of ). These results demonstrate that individual host genetic differences influence antibody measures of common infections in this population, and further investigation may elucidate the underlying immunological processes and genes involved.', 'Genetic factors influence serological measures of common infections.. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Antibodies against infectious pathogens provide information on past or present exposure to infectious agents. While host genetic factors are known to affect the immune response, the influence of genetic factors on antibody levels to common infectious agents is largely unknown. Here we test whether antibody levels for common infections are significantly heritable. METHODS: IgG antibodies to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, Toxoplasma gondii, adenovirus (Ad36), hepatitis A virus, influenza A and B, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV)- and -, human herpesvirus-, and varicella zoster virus were determined for , Mexican Americans. Both quantitative and dichotomous (seropositive/seronegative) traits were analyzed. Influences of genetic and shared environmental factors were estimated using variance components pedigree analysis, and sharing of underlying genetic factors among traits was investigated using bivariate analyses. RESULTS: Serological phenotypes were significantly heritable for most pathogens (h() = -), except for Ad36 and HSV-. Shared environment was significant for several pathogens (c() = -). The underlying genetic etiology appears to be largely different for most pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate, for the first time for many of these pathogens, that individual genetic differences of the human host contribute substantially to antibody levels to many common infectious agents, providing impetus for the identification of underlying genetic variants, which may be of clinical importance.']",virus; pathogens; cmv; infections; infectious; gondii; herpes; cytomegalovirus; toxoplasma; simplex,virus · pathogens · cmv

AIM: To study the impact on cleavage of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF1) regulated by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). METHODS: Cleavage of TRAF1 was detected by western blotting in the human gastric cancer cell line AGS following treatment with an apoptosis inducer. Cleavage of TRAF1 mediated by caspase was examined in vitro using specific caspase inhibitors. The effect of the COOH-terminal TRAF1 fragment on gastric cell apoptosis during H. pylori infection was measured using flow cytometry. The impact of H. pylori infection on TRAF1 cleavage was detected in the presence of apoptosis inducer. The roles of H. pylori virulence factors that may regulate TRAF1 cleavage were analyzed using isogenic cagA-, vacA- and cagE-null mutants. RESULTS: TRAF1 was found to be cleaved in AGS cells treated with the apoptosis inducer, and caspase- was the major caspase involved in the cleavage of TRAF1. The COOH-terminal TRAF1 fragment significantly induced cell apoptosis (P < ) as well as promoted H. pylori-induced cell apoptosis (P < ). H. pylori infection was found to significantly inhibit the cleavage of TRAF1 and to inhibit the activation of caspase- in the presence of the apoptosis inducer at specific infection times and different cell/bacteria ratios. We also found that the effects of cagE- and cagA-null mutants on the inhibition of TRAF1 cleavage and activation of caspase- were significantly attenuated, compared with wild-type H. pylori, in the presence of the apoptosis inducer, showing that the virulence factor CagA was mainly involved in the inhibition of TRAF1 cleavage. CONCLUSION: H. pylori infection significantly inhibits the cleavage of TRAF1 via a CagA-dependent mechanism, which would increase the relative amounts of full-length TRAF1 and exert an antiapoptotic effect on H. pylori-infected cells.', 'Helicobacter pylori VacA modulates TRAF1-mediated 4-1BB/NF-kappaB axis to induce host apoptosis and chronic inflammatory damage.. BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection is the primary cause of gastric cancer. We previously demonstrated that TRAF1 expression was significantly increased during the multistep pathological timeline of Correa’s cascade and that these changes were closely correlated with Hp virulence factor VacA. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. METHODS: TRAF1-deficient or overexpressing human gastric mucosal epithelial cells were generated, and wild-type/vacA-KO mutant Hp, recombinant VacA protein and pDsRED2-N1-HA/VacA plasmid were used for mechanistic investigation of VacA. In addition, we established mice infection models and evaluated gastric pathological changes. RESULTS: RNA sequencing and cellular experiments suggested that positive correlations between TRAF1 expression and NF-κB pathway activation and apoptosis. VacA increased the protein levels of TRAF1, -1BB, p-IKKα/β, phosphorylated p65, Bax, and the downstream inflammatory factor IL- but reduced that of Bcl-xl, promoting apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation in vitro. Transient and stable overexpression of TRAF1 promoted VacA-induced -1BB expression, NF-κB pathways activation, apoptosis-related molecules levels, and downstream inflammatory factors secretion in gastric epithelial cells, whereas silencing of TRAF1 led to the opposite effects. Functionally, TRAF1 increased VacA-induced p65 nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity, leading to apoptosis. BAY11- (an NF-κB inhibitor) or -1BB blocking antibody attenuated the promotive effect of TRAF1 overexpression on VacA-induced NF-κB pathway activation, apoptosis-related protein expression, and downstream inflammatory factors secretion in gastric epithelial cells, whereas -1BB agonist antibody reversed the inhibitory effect of TRAF1 silencing on VacA function. In vivo, the immunofluorescence of TRAF1, -1BB and NF-κB p65 at vacA+Hp colonization sites was increased, and TRAF1 expression increased gradually with prolonged infection, correlating with exacerbated gastric mucosal inflammation and damage. Hp eradication or BAY11- treatment reversed TRAF1 expression in mouse mucosal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: We revealed a novel VacA–TRAF1–NF-κB pathway–IL- signalling axis, exposing novel connections among Hp infection, inflammation and gastric tumorigenesis. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: [Image: see text] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at /s10020---.', 'The Upregulation of TRAF1 Induced by Helicobacter pylori Plays an Antiapoptotic Effect on the Infected Cells.. BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF1) is a member of the TRAF family and is dysregulated in diseases, such as atheroma, lymphoma, and solid tumors, but the role of TRAF1 in gastric cancer remains unknown. This study was aimed to investigate the role of TRAF1 in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-related cell apoptosis and gastric carcinogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mRNA and protein expression levels of TRAF1 were measured in a panel of gastric cancer cell lines and in H. pylori -infected mice by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting. The transcription factor that mainly affects transcription of TRAF1 during H. pylori infection was identified. The roles of H. pylori virulence factors that regulate TRAF1 expression were analyzed using isogenic cagA-, vacA-, and cagE-null mutants. The effects of TRAF1 on gastric cell viability and apoptosis during H. pylori infection were detected using the standard MTS (cell viability) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: H. pylori infection induced TRAF1 overexpression in both gastric epithelial cells and mice. The expression of TRAF1 in response to H. pylori infection was majorly regulated by the activation of NF-κB and was strongly related to H. pylori virulence factor CagA. The upregulation of TRAF1 inhibited cell apoptosis and increased the viability of infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection induces the overexpression of TRAF1 in gastric epithelial cells. The upregulation of TRAF1 plays an antiapoptotic role in H. pylori -infected gastric cells and may contribute to the gastric carcinogenesis.']",activation; kinase; nfb; nfkappab; traf1; tak1; hkalpha; phosphorylation; nuclear; cells,activation · kinase · nfb

BACKGROUND: The formation of a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues stabilizes protein structure. Although we now have a good understanding of the Escherichia coli disulfide formation system, the machineries at work in other bacteria, including pathogens, are poorly characterized. Thus, the objective of this work was to improve our understanding of the disulfide formation machinery of Helicobacter pylori, a leading cause of ulcers and a risk factor for stomach cancer worldwide. METHODS AND RESULTS: The protein HP0231 from H. pylori, a structural counterpart of E. coli DsbG, is the focus of this research. Its function was clarified by using a combination of biochemical, microbiological and genetic approaches. In particular, we determined the biochemical properties of HP0231 as well as its redox state in H. pylori cells. CONCLUSION: Altogether our results show that HP0231 is an oxidoreductase that catalyzes disulfide bond formation in the periplasm. We propose to call it HpDsbA.', 'Functional and evolutionary analyses of Helicobacter pylori HP0231 (DsbK) protein with strong oxidative and chaperone activity characterized by a highly diverged dimerization domain.. Helicobacter pylori does not encode the classical DsbA/DsbB oxidoreductases that are crucial for oxidative folding of extracytoplasmic proteins. Instead, this microorganism encodes an untypical two proteins playing a role in disulfide bond formation - periplasmic HP0231, which structure resembles that of EcDsbC/DsbG, and its redox partner, a membrane protein HpDsbI (HP0595) with a β-propeller structure. The aim of presented work was to assess relations between HP0231 structure and function. We showed that HP0231 is most closely related evolutionarily to the catalytic domain of DsbG, even though it possesses a catalytic motif typical for canonical DsbA proteins. Similarly, the highly diverged N-terminal dimerization domain is homologous to the dimerization domain of DsbG. To better understand the functioning of this atypical oxidoreductase, we examined its activity using in vivo and in vitro experiments. We found that HP0231 exhibits oxidizing and chaperone activities but no isomerizing activity, even though H. pylori does not contain a classical DsbC. We also show that HP0231 is not involved in the introduction of disulfide bonds into HcpC (Helicobacter cysteine-rich protein C), a protein involved in the modulation of the H. pylori interaction with its host. Additionally, we also constructed a truncated version of HP0231 lacking the dimerization domain, denoted HP0231m, and showed that it acts in Escherichia coli cells in a DsbB-dependent manner. In contrast, HP0231m and classical monomeric EcDsbA (E. coli DsbA protein) were both unable to complement the lack of HP0231 in H. pylori cells, though they exist in oxidized forms. HP0231m is inactive in the insulin reduction assay and possesses high chaperone activity, in contrast to EcDsbA. In conclusion, HP0231 combines oxidative functions characteristic of DsbA proteins and chaperone activity characteristic of DsbC/DsbG, and it lacks isomerization activity.', 'Engineering of Helicobacter pylori Dimeric Oxidoreductase DsbK (HP0231).. The formation of disulfide bonds that are catalyzed by proteins of the Dsb (disulfide bond) family is crucial for the correct folding of many extracytoplasmic proteins. Thus, this formation plays an essential, pivotal role in the assembly of many virulence factors. The Helicobacter pylori disulfide bond-forming system is uncomplicated compared to the best-characterized Escherichia coli Dsb pathways. It possesses only two extracytoplasmic Dsb proteins named HP0377 and HP0231. As previously shown, HP0377 is a reductase involved in the process of cytochrome c maturation. Additionally, it also possesses disulfide isomerase activity. HP0231 was the first periplasmic dimeric oxidoreductase involved in disulfide generation to be described. Although HP0231 function is critical for oxidative protein folding, its structure resembles that of dimeric EcDsbG, which does not confer this activity. However, the HP0231 catalytic motifs (CXXC and the so-called cis-Pro loop) are identical to that of monomeric EcDsbA. To understand the functioning of HP0231, we decided to study the relations between its sequence, structure and activity through an extensive analysis of various HP0231 point mutants, using in vivo and in vitro strategies. Our work shows the crucial role of the cis-Pro loop, as changing valine to threonine in this motif completely abolishes the protein function in vivo. Functioning of HP0231 is conditioned by the combination of CXXC and the cis-Pro loop, as replacing the HP0231 CXXC motif by the motif from EcDsbG or EcDsbC results in bifunctional protein, at least in E. coli. We also showed that the dimerization domain of HP0231 ensures contact with its substrates. Moreover, the activity of this oxidase is independent on the structure of the catalytic domain. Finally, we showed that HP0231 chaperone activity is independent of its redox function.']",proteins; shape; disulfide; protein; structure; helical; domain; hp0231; cell; crystal,proteins · shape · disulfide

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends assessing screening for helicobacter pylori infection to lower gastric cancer (GC) rates. Therefore, we carried out a study to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different H. pylori screening approaches in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a Markov model with a -year time horizon and health system perspective to compare four H. pylori screening strategies (endoscopy, serology, urea breath test [UBT], stool antigen test [SAT]) to no screening in the population aged years and older in Iran. Model parameters were extracted from primary data and published studies. Cost data also came from medical records of patients at different stages of GC. We calculated costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for each strategy. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) using Monte Carlo simulation tested the model's robustness. All analyses were done in TreeAge Pro . RESULTS: All screening strategies provided more QALYs compared to no screening. Base-case analysis found the UBT strategy was the most cost-effective, with an ICER of ,, Iranian rial (IRR) per QALY gained, despite being more costly. No screening and endoscopy were dominated strategies, meaning they had higher costs but provided fewer effectiveness compared to other options. PSA showed at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of ,, IRR (Iran's GDP per capita) per QALY, UBT was the optimal strategy in % of iterations. CONCLUSION: This cost-effectiveness analysis found that screening for H. pylori may be cost-effective in Iran. Among the screening strategies examined, UBT was the most cost-effective approach. Further studies should do cost-effectiveness analyses for specific age groups to optimize the benefits achieved with limited resources."", 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of Helicobacter pylori screening in prevention of gastric cancer in Chinese.. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the costs and effectiveness associated with no screening, Helicobacter pylori serology screening, and the 13C-urea breath test (UBT) for gastric cancer in the Chinese population. METHODS: A Markov model simulation was carried out in Singaporean Chinese at years of age (n = ,) from the perspective of public healthcare providers. The main outcome measures were costs, number of gastric cancer cases prevented, life-years saved, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from the screening age to death, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), which were compared among the three strategies. The uncertainty surrounding ICERs was addressed by scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: The ICER of serology screening versus no screening was $, per QALY gained ( percent confidence interval ( percent CI), $, to $,). The ICER of UBT versus no screening was $, per QALY gained ( percent CI, $, to $,). ICER of UBT versus serology screening was $, per QALY gained, for which almost all random samples of the ICERs distributed above $, per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: It cannot be confidently concluded that either H pylori screening was a cost-effective strategy compared with no screening in all Chinese at the age of years. Nevertheless, serology screening has demonstrated much more potential to be a cost-effective strategy, especially in the population with higher gastric cancer prevalence.', ""Economic evaluation of preventing gastric cancer by eliminating Helicobacter pylori infection in China..

For each scenario, ,, individuals were simulated. Outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent a gastric cancer.

RESULTS: Compared with no screening, screening at , , and years of age once per lifetime were all cost-effective, with ICERs of -$, -$, and -$ per QALY gained, respectively. NNT of the three strategies were , , and . Screening with a high frequency was associated with higher cost and QALYs; in the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, no matter the initial screening age, screening every years would be the optimal strategy. CONCLUSION: Screening for H. pylori is a cost-saving and effective way to prevent gastric cancer in China.

Helicobacter pylori CagA is the first identified bacterial oncoprotein playing a critical role in gastric carcinogenesis. Upon delivery into gastric epithelial cells via type IV secretion, CagA is localized to the plasma membrane, where it acts as a pathogenic scaffold/hub that promiscuously interacts with a number of host signaling molecules. Especially, CagA binds to the polarity-regulating kinase PAR1/MARK and inhibits the kinase activity. Following tyrosine phosphorylation by host kinases, CagA also acquires the ability to interact with the oncogenic tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and deregulates the phosphatase activity. Through these interactions, CagA deregulates intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and cell movement, while causing epithelial junctional and polarity defects. These CagA activities collectively contribute to the development of gastric carcinoma.', 'The role of Helicobacter pylori CagA in gastric carcinogenesis.. Gastric carcinoma is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the world, accounting for more than , deaths each year. Infection with cagA-positive Helicobacter pylori plays a pivotal role in the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. The cagA gene product CagA is directly delivered into gastric epithelial cells via the type IV secretion system. Following membrane localization and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases, CagA interacts with a variety of host cell proteins that are involved in the regulation of cell growth and motility in both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent manners. Of special interest is the interaction of CagA with the SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-, gain-of-function mutations of which have recently been found in human malignancies. CagA binds to and activates SHP- in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner, thereby provoking abnormal activation of Erk MAP kinase while inducing elevated cell motility. Perturbation of SHP- and other signaling molecules by H pylori CagA may predispose cells to accumulate multiple genetic and epigenetic changes that promote multistep gastric carcinogenesis. Intriguingly, the structural polymorphism of CagA accounts for the differences in pathophysiological activity of individual CagA proteins, raising the possibility of subclassification of H pylori strains into benign and malignant strains.', ""Helicobacter pylori CagA -- a bacterial intruder conspiring gastric carcinogenesis.. Infection with cagA-positive Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is associated with the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. The cagA gene product CagA is delivered from the bacterium into the cytoplasm of the bacterium-attached gastric epithelial cell via the type-IV secretion system. Upon membrane localization and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases, translocated CagA functions as a scaffolding adaptor that interacts with a number of host proteins involved in cell signaling in both tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent and -independent manners. Of special interest is the interaction of CagA with the SHP- tyrosine phosphatase, of which gain-of-function mutations have recently been found in human malignancies. Through the complex formation, SHP- is catalytically activated and induces morphological transformation that is associated with increased cell motility. In addition to the perturbation of intracellular signaling, CagA disrupts the apical junctional complex that regulates the cell-cell contact and maintains the integrity of the epithelial structure. These CagA activities may collectively cause cellular dysfunctions that promote accumulation of multiple genetic changes involved in malignant transformation. Further elucidation of host cell signaling targeted by CagA should provide a new paradigm for 'bacterial carcinogenesis' and also give insights into general understanding of inflammation-mediated cancers. Clinically, detailed studies on the relationship between structural diversity and degree of pathogenic activity of CagA should make it possible to identify a high-risk group for gastric carcinoma among H. pylori-infected populations through cagA genotyping.""]",caga; epithelial; cells; expression; cell; gastric; signaling; oncoprotein; alphapix; protein,caga · epithelial · cells

Transcriptional expression of Mmp- and Mmp- was evaluated via qPCR while respective protein levels in the gastric mucosa were determined immunohistochemically. Epithelial cell lines AGS and GES- were infected with H. pylori strain P12 in the presence of chemical inhibitors of JNK, ERK1/, and p38 pathways, for h. mRNA and protein expression of MMP- and MMP- were determined via qPCR and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: We observed transcriptional activation of Mmp- and Mmp- as well as aberrant MMP- and MMP- protein expression in murine gastric tissue following H. pylori infection. CagA expression was associated with MMP upregulation, particularly during the early time points of infection. We found that inhibition of ERK1/ resulted in reduced mRNA and protein expression of MMP- and MMP- during H. pylori infection, in both cell lines. Expressed protein levels of both MMPs were also found reduced in the presence of JNK pathway inhibitors in both cell lines. However, p38 inhibition resulted in a more complex effect, probably attributed to the accumulation of phospho-p38 and increased phospho-ERK1/ activity due to crosstalk between MAPK pathways. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori colonization leads to the upregulation of MMP- and MMP- in vivo, which primarily involves ERK1/ and JNK pathways. Therefore, their inhibition may potentially offer a protective effect against gastric carcinogenesis and metastasis.']",mmp; matrix; timp; mmps; mt; metalloproteinases; expression; metalloproteinase; secretion; mmp9,mmp · matrix · timp

Objective: Vitamin D3 has the general properties of a lipid-soluble vitamin, but is also an active steroid hormone that can regulate the proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation of many tumor cells, and exerts anticancer activity against numerous malignancies. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of vitamin D3 on tumors is not fully understood. Here, we used network pharmacology and in vitro experimental approaches to explore the mechanism of vitamin D3 activity in the context of gastric cancer. Methods: The Targetnet, SuperPred, SwissTargetPrediction, and PharmMapper databases were screened for potential drug-related targets, while we used data from the PharmGKB, Drugbank, OMIM, DisGeNET, CTD, and GeneCards databases to identify potential targets associated with gastric cancer. Disease-drug crossover genes were obtained by constructing Venn diagrams. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of crossover genes were conducted and STRING was used to generate protein interaction networks and identify core targets. CCK- experiments were performed and apoptosis detected to assess the effect of vitamin D3 on gastric cancer cells. Western blotting was applied to detect p53/AMPK/mTOR signaling, as well as autophagy-, cell cycle-, and apoptosis-related proteins. Results: A total of targets of vitamin D3 activity were obtained and gastric cancer disease-related targets discovered. Further, potential targets for vitamin D3 in gastric cancer treatment were identified. KEGG analysis indicated that potential targets were mainly involved in the cell cycle, HIF- signaling, and the AMPK pathway, among other pathways. These findings were validated using cellular experiments, which demonstrated that the viability of AGS and SGC- cells was impeded by vitamin D3. Further, vitamin D3 promoted apoptosis and inhibited the cell cycle in those cell lines, as well as activating the p53/AMPK/mTOR pathway, which promotes autophagy and inhibits tumor development. Conclusion: Our network pharmacological analyses provide preliminarily data supporting a role for vitamin D3 in promoting autophagy and apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, and in activating the p53/AMPK/mTOR pathway, which inhibits gastric cancer cell proliferation.
