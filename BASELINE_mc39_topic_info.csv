Gastric adenocarcinoma carries a poor prognosis, in part due to the late stage of diagnosis. Risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, family history of gastric cancer-in particular, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and pernicious anaemia. The stages in the progression to cancer include chronic gastritis, gastric atrophy (GA), gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) and dysplasia. The key to early detection of cancer and improved survival is to non-invasively identify those at risk before endoscopy. However, although biomarkers may help in the detection of patients with chronic atrophic gastritis, there is insufficient evidence to support their use for population screening. High-quality endoscopy with full mucosal visualisation is an important part of improving early detection. Image-enhanced endoscopy combined with biopsy sampling for histopathology is the best approach to detect and accurately risk-stratify GA and GIM. Biopsies following the Sydney protocol from the antrum, incisura, lesser and greater curvature allow both diagnostic confirmation and risk stratification for progression to cancer. Ideally biopsies should be directed to areas of GA or GIM visualised by high-quality endoscopy. There is insufficient evidence to support screening in a low-risk population (undergoing routine diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy) such as the UK, but endoscopic surveillance every years should be offered to patients with extensive GA or GIM. Endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection of visible gastric dysplasia and early cancer has been shown to be efficacious with a high success rate and low rate of recurrence, providing that specific quality criteria are met.', 'Gene expression and protein profiling of AGS gastric epithelial cells upon infection with Helicobacter pylori.. Helicobacter pylori, one of the most common bacterial pathogens, colonizes the human stomach and causes a variety of gastric diseases. This pathogen elicits a range of phenotypic responses in infected cultured AGS gastric epithelial cells, including expression of proinflammatory genes and changes in the actin cytoskeleton. Some of these responses are mediated by the type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded by the cag pathogenicity island. We have used two global approaches, namely -DE combined with PMF and cDNA expression array analyses, to study in both a comprehensive and quantitative manner the protein profile and the temporal patterns of mRNA accumulation in AGS cells upon infection with H. pylori and isogenic T4SS mutants. We identified transcripts and detected protein species that were differentially regulated upon infection. Infection with wild-type H. pylori induced expression of a variety of host genes and changes in protein pattern involved in transcriptional responses, cell shape regulation and signal transduction. Among them, some were differentially regulated in a cag PAI-dependent manner, as shown by both the proteomic and cDNA expression array approaches. While -DE and PMF allowed us to examine the protein profiles in the infected host, array analysis enabled us to demonstrate dynamic temporal changes in host gene expression profile. In conclusion, our combined application of the two global approaches provides further molecular details on how the host cell responds to infection by H. pylori and its isogenic T4SS mutants on both transcriptional and protein levels. The findings pinpoint host proteins such as serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, transcription factors, cell cycle related components and actin cytoskeletal signaling molecules as potential targets of individual H. pylori virulence determinants. This study serves as a basis for future work on transcription and proteome analyses of the H. pylori infection model.', 'H. pylori infection and gastric cancer: state of the art (review).. Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading types of cancer worldwide, particularly in East Asian populations. Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection has been established as a major risk factor for GC. Although more than % of the world population is infected with this bacterium, less than % develop GC. Therefore, further risk factors (such as host genetic polymorphisms and lifestyle, as well as environmental and epigenetic factors) may also play a role in its occurrence. The correlation between HP infection and GC represents a typical model of a multi‑step process, characterized by some pre-neoplastic lesions with a high risk of progression (atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia). In addition, HP also plays an oncogenic role in the development of mucosa‑associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, that accounts for approximately % of all gastric tumors. Hyperplastic polyps often arise in patients with atrophic gastric mucosa and HP‑associated gastritis (% of cases); however, their malignant transformation is rare (<% of cases). A number of trials have demonstrated the possibility of cancer prevention through HP screening and eradication, particularly in high‑risk populations, whereas it may not be cost‑effective in areas of low risk. In this review, we discuss i) the complex pathogenetic mechanisms of gastric carcinogenesis in which HP is involved; ii) the main approaches to the diagnosis, prevention, surveillance and treatment of pre-malignant lesions associated with HP infection; iii) the most effective way to detect GC in its earlier stages; and iv) the most important contribution to reducing the burden of GC.']",of; the; in; gastric; and; pylori; to; expression; with; that,Outliers

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of high-dose amoxicillin-proton pump inhibitor dual therapy, and to provide a new eradication regimen as a first-line option for patients with H. pylori infection. METHODS: A total of H. pylori positive patients who received initial treatment were recruited from March to August , and randomly divided into treatment group and control group. The treatment group received of mg esomeprazole four times daily and mg amoxicillin four times daily for days. Control group received of mg bismuth potassium citrate twice daily, mg esomeprazole twice daily, mg amoxicillin twice daily and mg clarithromycin capsule twice daily for days. Four weeks after the end of treatment, the urea breath test was reviewed to detect whether H. pylori was eradicated. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in age, gender, the total clinical symptom scores before and after initial treatment, the compliance, and the degree of remission of symptoms before and after initial treatment between the two groups. The eradication rates of H. pylori between dual therapy and quadruple therapy were % and % (p=.) by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, % and % (p=.) by modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis, and % and % (p=.) by PP analysis, respectively. Adverse events in dual therapy group were significantly lower than quadruple therapy group (% vs. % (p<.)). CONCLUSIONS: For the initial treatment of H. pylori infection, the high-dose dual therapy regimen has the same efficacy as the bismuth-containing quadruple therapy regimen, good compliance, less adverse reactions and high safety, so it can be recommended as the empirical first-line treatment regimen for the eradication of H. pylori (KY2019173).', '14\u2009day sequential therapy versus 10\u2009day bismuth quadruple therapy containing high-dose esomeprazole in the first-line and second-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori: a multicentre, non-inferiority, randomized trial.. BACKGROUND: Whether extending the treatment length and the use of high-dose esomeprazole may optimize the efficacy of Helicobacter pylori eradication remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of optimized day sequential therapy and day bismuth quadruple therapy containing high-dose esomeprazole in first-line therapy. METHODS: We recruited adult patients (≥ years of age) with H. pylori infection naive to treatment in this multicentre, open-label, randomized trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive day sequential therapy or day bismuth quadruple therapy, both containing esomeprazole mg twice daily. Those who failed after day sequential therapy received rescue therapy with day bismuth quadruple therapy and vice versa. Our primary outcome was the eradication rate in the first-line therapy. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03156855. RESULTS: The eradication rates of day sequential therapy and day bismuth quadruple therapy were % ( of , % CI %-%) and % ( of , % CI %-%) in the ITT analysis, respectively (difference -%, % CI -% to %, P = ). However, the frequencies of adverse effects were significantly higher in patients treated with day bismuth quadruple therapy than those treated with day sequential therapy (% versus % P < ). The eradication rate of day sequential therapy in strains with and without 23S ribosomal RNA mutation was % ( of ) and % ( of ), respectively (P < ). CONCLUSIONS: Optimized day sequential therapy was non-inferior to, but better tolerated than day bismuth quadruple therapy and both may be used in first-line treatment in populations with low to intermediate clarithromycin resistance.', 'Second-line rescue triple therapy with levofloxacin after failure of non-bismuth quadruple ""sequential"" or ""concomitant"" treatment to eradicate H. pylori infection.. BACKGROUND: Non-bismuth quadruple ""sequential"" and ""concomitant"" regimens, including a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin, clarithromycin and a nitroimidazole, are increasingly used as first-line treatments for Helicobacter pylori infection. Eradication with rescue regimens may be challenging after failure of key antibiotics such as clarithromycin and nitroimidazoles. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a second-line levofloxacin-containing triple regimen (PPI-amoxicillin-levofloxacin) in the eradication of H. pylori after non-bismuth quadruple-containing treatment failure. DESIGN: prospective multicenter study. PATIENTS: in whom a non-bismuth quadruple regimen, administered either sequentially (PPI + amoxicillin for days followed by PPI + clarithromycin + metronidazole for more days) or concomitantly (PPI + amoxicillin + clarithromycin + metronidazole for days) had previously failed. INTERVENTION: levofloxacin ( mg b.i.d.), amoxicillin ( g b.i.d.) and PPI (standard dose b.i.d.) for days. OUTCOME: eradication was confirmed with ()C-urea breath test - weeks after therapy. Compliance and tolerance: compliance was determined through questioning and recovery of empty medication envelopes. Incidence of adverse effects was evaluated by means of a questionnaire. RESULTS: consecutive patients were included (mean age years, % females, % peptic ulcer and % dyspepsia): after ""sequential"", and after ""concomitant"" treatment failure. All patients took all medications correctly. Overall, per-protocol and intention-to-treat H. pylori eradication rates were % (% CI -%) and % (-%). Respective intention-to-treat cure rates for ""sequential"" and ""concomitant"" failure regimens were % and %, respectively. Adverse effects were reported in six (%) patients; all of them were mild.

Peptic ulcer bleeding remains an important emergency situation with a high incidence and carries significant morbidity and mortality. Current evidence suggests that H. pylori and NSAIDs increase the risk of peptic ulcer bleeding and these two factors seem to act independently. Testing for, and cure of, H. pylori infection is recommended in patients prior to the initiation of NSAID therapy and in those who are currently receiving NSAIDs and have a history of peptic ulcer bleeding. For patients who present with peptic ulcer bleeding but require NSAIDs long-term, H. pylori eradication therapy should be considered, followed by continuous proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis to prevent re-bleeding, regardless of which kind of NSAID (nonselective NSAID/coxib) is being prescribed. The success of eradication should always be confirmed because of the risk of peptic ulcer recurrences and bleeding complication.', 'Risk factors for peptic ulcer bleeding in terms of Helicobacter pylori, NSAIDs, and antiplatelet agents.. OBJECTIVES: The role of the Helicobacter pylori, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and antiplatelet agents in the risk of peptic ulcer bleeding has not yet been established. This study was performed to identify the risk factors for peptic ulcer bleeding compared with non-bleeding peptic ulcer disease (PUD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of patients, with bleeding PUD and with non-bleeding PUD were consecutively recruited. H. pylori status was determined by histology, rapid urease test, and culture. Exposure to NSAIDs, aspirin, and antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel and ticlopidine) within weeks was obtained. RESULTS: Compared with non-bleeding PUD, bleeding PUD had a higher proportion of male gender and current smoking, alcohol drinking, history of aspirin/antiplatelet use, and history of PUD. Whereas the proportion of H. pylori infection and history of H. pylori eradication in bleeding PUD were significantly lower than that in non-bleeding PUD. In multivariate analysis, male gender (OR , % CI -), drinking alcohol (OR , % CI -), aspirin/antiplatelet use (OR , % CI -), and history of PUD (OR , % CI -) remained independent risk factors for bleeding PUD. When H. pylori status and aspirin/antiplatelet agent use were combined, highest risk of bleeding peptic ulcers was found among H. pylori-negative patients with a history of aspirin/antiplatelet agent use (OR % CI -) compared with H. pylori-positive patients with no history of aspirin/antiplatelet agent use. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with H. pylori-negative peptic ulcers who continuously took aspirin or antiplatelet agents had the highest peptic ulcer bleeding risk.', '[Role of Helicobacter pylori infection and use of NSAIDs in the etiopathogenesis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding].. INTRODUCTION: Non-steroid antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection are two most important independent risk factors involved in the etiopathogenesis of gastroduodenal mucosal injury with a clear and critical role in both uncomplicated and complicated peptic ulcer disease. It is estimated that upto % of all peptic ulcers result from the effect of one or both of these factors. AIM: To determine the frequency of NSAIDs use and Hp infection in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study evaluated data from patients in whom esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed following presentation in emergency unit with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Anamnestic data was collected together with detailed information on previous salicilates and/or NSAIDs use. Hp status was determined and anatomic localisation of bleeding lesion was also registered. RESULTS: Acute upper GIT bleading was caused solely by NSAIDs in (%), by aspirin in (%), while combined NSAID/aspirin therapy was identified in (%) of patients. In total NSAID and/or aspirin use were diagnosed in (%). while in (%) only Hp infection was diagnosed. Both risk factors were identified in (%) patients (Hp+NSAIDs in %, Hp+aspirin in % and Hp+aspirin+NSAIDs in %). In % of the cases (% of males and % of females) neither NSAID/aspirin use nor presence of Hp infection was noted. Out of patients enrolled, % were mails. In females, bleeding lesion was most frequently localized in gastric mucosa, while males had equal chance of bleeding from either gastric or duodenal mucosa. Fortunatelly, only to % of patients were bleeding from both gastric and duodenal lesion. CONCLUSION: Prevention of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be achieved trough strict and limited use of aspirin and NSAIDs, eradication of Hp infection and use of gastroprotective therapy in well-defined risk patients that need chronic NSAIDs and/or aspirin therapy. In all patients starting long-term NSAID and/or aspirin therapy and all patients already on long-term aspirin therapy test and treat strategy for Hp infection should be used. On the other hand, only in high risk patients (more than years, history of peptic ulcer disease, concomitant corticosteroid, aspirin, clopidogrel or warfarin therapy) already on chronic NSAID therapy long-term PPI therapy should be prescribed after testing and treating of Hp infection.']",ulcer; bleeding; peptic; ulcers; aspirin; nsaids; patients; duodenal; nsaid; nonsteroidal,ulcer · bleeding · peptic

Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, which was first reported in , shows an indolent clinical course. However, the detailed clinicopathological characteristics of gastric MALT lymphoma have not been fully elucidated. We performed a literature search concerning the clinical features and treatment for gastric MALT lymphoma using PubMED. MALT lymphomas develop in single or multiple extranodal organs, of which the stomach is one of the most frequent sites; gastric MALT lymphoma accounts for % to % of all B-cell lymphomas, and % to % of primary gastric lymphomas. The eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the first-line treatment for patients with gastric MALT lymphoma, regardless of the clinical stage. Approximately -% of cases with stage I/II1 disease only achieve a complete histological response via H. pylori eradication. In patients who do not respond to H. pylori eradication therapy, second-line treatments such as watch-and-wait, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, rituximab immunotherapy, and/or a combination of these are recommended. Thus, H. pylori plays a causative role in the pathogenesis of gastric MALT lymphoma, and H. pylori eradication leads to complete histological remission in the majority of cases.', 'Comparison of localized gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma with and without Helicobacter pylori infection.. BACKGROUND: The clinical features and clinical course of Helicobacter pylori-negative gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma are unclear and a treatment strategy has not yet been established. AIM: To clarify the clinical differences between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphoma, we compared these two types of gastric MALT lymphoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with localized gastric MALT lymphoma were studied. H. pylori infection was present in and absent in . Treatment consisted of antibiotic therapy and/or Gy radiation therapy. Response assessment was performed every - months by esophagogastroduodenoscopy including gathering biopsy samples, endoscopic ultrasonography, clinical examination, and various imaging procedures. The median follow-up period was months. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphoma patients in terms of sex, age, stage, gross phenotype, affected area of the stomach, or the presence of monoclonality. Complete regression was achieved with antibiotic therapy against H. pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphoma in one of nine patients (%), compared to of patients (%) with H. pylori-positive gastric MALT lymphoma (p < .). Radiation therapy showed high effectiveness for the local control of H. pylori-negative or antibiotic-resistant gastric MALT lymphoma (%), although distant recurrence was recognized in three of patients (%). Two of patients (%) with H. pylori-negative gastric MALT lymphoma died because of the transformation of the disease into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. There was a significant difference in both the overall and cause-specific survival rate between the two groups (p = .). CONCLUSION: Radiation therapy is the effective treatment for H. pylori-negative or antibiotic-resistant localized gastric MALT lymphoma. However, careful systemic follow-up for distant involvement should be required. Transformation into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is thought to be the important cause of death in patients with gastric MALT lymphoma.', 'Clinical course of duodenal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma: Comparison with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.. BACKGROUND AND AIM: There are few cases of duodenal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma reported in the literature, and little is known about the clinical course of this disease. Here, we aimed to characterize the clinical features of duodenal MALT lymphoma by comparison with gastric MALT lymphoma. METHODS: Thirteen patients diagnosed with duodenal MALT lymphoma at Asan Medical Center from March to February were included in this retrospective study, along with patients with gastric MALT lymphoma, matched by age and sex at a : ratio. RESULTS: Median age of patients with duodenal MALT lymphoma was (range -) years, and % (/) were male. Comparison of patient characteristics indicated that Helicobacter pylori infection (% vs %, P < ) and lymph node metastasis (% vs %, P = ) rates differed between patients with duodenal and gastric MALT lymphoma. Overall complete remission (% vs %, P = ) and complete remission after initial H. pylori eradication therapy (% vs %, P = ) were significantly lower in patients with duodenal than gastric MALT lymphoma. Complications including bleeding, stricture, and transformation to high-grade lymphoma occurred in a total of seven patients (%), with a higher incidence in patients with duodenal than gastric MALT lymphoma (% vs %, P < ).

BACKGROUND: Chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer have been shown to be related to infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Two major virulence factors of H. pylori, CagA and VacA, have been associated with these sequelae of the infection. In this study, total DNA was isolated from gastric biopsy specimens to assess the cagA and vacA genotypes. RESULTS: Variations in H. pylori cagA EPIYA motifs and the mosaic structure of vacA s/m/i/d regions were analysed in H. pylori-positive gastric biopsies from individuals using PCR and sequencing. Analysis of a possible association between cagA and vacA genotypes and gastroduodenal pathogenesis was made by logistic regression analysis. We found that H. pylori strains with variation in the number of cagA EPIYA motif variants present in the same biopsy correlated with peptic ulcer, while occurrence of two or more EPIYA-C motifs was associated with atrophy in the gastric mucosa. No statistically significant relation between vacA genotypes and gastroduodenal pathogenesis was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that cagA genotypes may be important determinants in the development of gastroduodenal sequelae of H. pylori infection. In contrast to other studies, vacA genotypes were not related to disease progression or outcome. In order to fully understand the relations between cagA, vacA and gastroduodenal pathogenesis, the mechanisms by which CagA and VacA act and interact need to be further investigated.', 'Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori vacA, cagA and iceA genotypes in South African patients with upper gastrointestinal diseases.. Clinical response to Helicobacter pylori infection may be determined by specific virulence-associated genotypes which varies geographically. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversity of putative virulence markers of H. pylori; cagA, vacA and iceA in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. One hundred H. pylori strains obtained from dyspeptic patients were used. Gastric biopsies were obtained from dyspeptic patients. H. pylori was cultured and strains were studied. Bacterial genotypes cagA, vacA (s and m subtypes) and iceA were analysed by PCR using specific primers. CagA was identified in % of the strains investigated. Fifty-eight of the strains had the vacA signal sequence genotype s1 and had subtype s2. Combined vacA s1/s2 was detected in of the strains. VacA middle region analysis showed that (%) strains were m1 while were m2. Combined vacA m1/m2 was detected in of the strains. s1m2 (%) and s2m2 (%) genotypes were the most common allelic combinations of the vacA gene among the strains. Multiple vacA genotypes were detected in this study. Twenty-six percent of the strains identified had both iceA1 and iceA2. All our strains tested positive for the ureC (glmM) gene. This study reveals a high prevalence of vacA, cagA and iceA2.', 'Correlation of Helicobacter pylori genotypes with gastric histopathology in the central region of a South-European country.. BACKGROUND: Outcome of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection results from interaction of multiple variables including host, environmental and bacterial-associated virulence factors. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the correlation of cagA, cagE, vacA, iceA and babA2 genotypes with gastric histopathology and disease phenotype in the central region of a South-European country. METHODS: This prospective study involved infected patients ( female; mean age ± years) submitted to endoscopy with corpus and antrum biopsies. H. pylori was cultured and DNA extracted from the isolates. Genotypes were determined by PCR. Histopathological features were graded according to the updated Sydney system and OLGA/OLGIM classification. Only patients with single H. pylori genotypes and complete histopathological results were included. RESULTS: Antrum samples presented higher degrees of atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, chronic inflammation and neutrophil activity. Genotype distribution was as follows: cagA- %; cagE- %; vacA s1a- %; vacA s1b- %; vacA s1c- %; vacA s2- %; vacA m1- %; vacA m2- %; vacA s1m1- %; vacA s1m2- %; vacA s2m1- %; vacA s2m2- %; iceA1- %; iceA2- %; babA2- %. CagA genotype was significantly associated with higher degrees of intestinal metaplasia, neutrophil activity, chronic inflammation and OLGIM stages. BabA2 was linked with higher H. pylori density. Strains with vacA s1m1 or vacA s1m1 + cagA positive genotypes had a significant association with peptic ulcer and vacA s2m2 with iron-deficient anemia. CONCLUSIONS: cagA, vacA s1m1 and babA2 genotypes are relatively rare in the central region of Portugal. cagA-positive strains are correlated with more severe histopathological modifications.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-inducing protein (Tipα) is a newly identified carcinogenic factor secreted by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Although it has been proved that Tipα is a strong inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a crucial process of migration, the exact molecular mechanism is unknown. Current evidence indicates that the oncogenic transcription factor signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT3) is inappropriately activated in multiple malignancies, including gastric cancer. In this study, we showed that Tipα significantly down-regulated the expression of EMT-related markers E-cadherin as well as up-regulated N-cadherin and vimentin in SGC7901 cells, with typical morphological changes of EMT. Tipα also promoted proliferation and migration of SGC7901 cells. Furthermore, Tipα activated interleukin- (IL-)/STAT3 signaling pathway in SGC7901 cells. The effects of Tipα treatment observed was abolished when we block IL-/STAT3 signaling pathway. Altogether, our data demonstrated that Tipα may accelerate tumor aggressiveness in gastric cancer by promoting EMT through activation of IL-/STAT3 pathway.', 'Stem Cells, Helicobacter pylori, and Mutational Landscape: Utility of Preclinical Models to Understand Carcinogenesis and to Direct Management of Gastric Cancer.. Several genetic and environmental factors increase gastric cancer (GC) risk, with Helicobacter pylori being the main environmental agent. GC is thought to emerge through a sequence of morphological changes that have been elucidated on the molecular level. New technologies have shed light onto pathways that are altered in GC, involving mutational and epigenetic changes and altered signaling pathways. Using various new model systems and innovative approaches, the relevance of such alterations for the emergence and progression of GC has been validated. Here, we highlight the key strategies and the resulting achievements. A major step is the characterization of epithelial stem cell behavior in the healthy stomach. These data, obtained through new reporter mouse lines and lineage tracing, enabled insights into the processes that control cellular proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation of gastric stem cells. It has become evident that these cells and pathways are often deregulated in carcinogenesis. Second, insights into how H pylori colonizes gastric glands, directly interacts with stem cells, and alters cellular and genomic integrity, as well as the characterization of tissue responses to infection, provide a comprehensive picture of how this bacterium contributes to gastric carcinogenesis. Third, the development of stem cell- and tissue-specific reporter mice have driven our understanding of the signals and mutations that promote different types of GC and now also enable the study of more advanced, metastasized stages. Finally, organoids from human tissue have allowed insights into gastric carcinogenesis by validating mutational and signaling alterations in human primary cells and opening a route to predicting responses to personalized treatment.', 'EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitory peptide attenuates Helicobacter pylori-mediated hyper-proliferation in AGS enteric epithelial cells.. Helicobacter pylori infection is one of the most critical causes of stomach cancer. The current study was conducted to explore the protective effects of an isolated active peptide H-P- (Pro-Gln-Pro-Lys-Val-Leu-Asp-Ser) from microbial hydrolysates of Chlamydomonas sp. against H. pylori-induced carcinogenesis. The peptide H-P- has effectively suppressed H. pylori-induced hyper-proliferation and migration of gastric epithelial cells (AGS). However, the peptide did not inhibit the viability of the bacteria or invasion into AGS cells. Therefore, the effect of the peptide on regulating H. pylori-induced molecular signaling was investigated. The results indicated that H. pylori activates the EGFR tyrosine kinase signaling and nuclear translocation of the β-catenin. The EGFR activation has led to the up-regulation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, the nuclear translocation levels of β-catenin were significantly increased as a result of Akt mediated down-regulation of GSK3/β protein levels in the cytoplasm. Both of these consequences have resulted in increased expression of cell survival and migration related genes such as c-Myc, cyclin-D, MMP- and matrilysin. Interestingly, the isolated peptide potently inhibited H. pylori-mediated EGFR activation and thereby down-regulated the subsequent P13K/Akt signaling leading to β-catenin nuclear translocation. The effect of the peptide was confirmed with the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1487 and molecular docking studies. Collectively this study identifies a potent peptide which regulates the H. pylori-induced hyper-proliferation and migration of AGS cells at molecular level.']",cells; expression; gastric; cell; epithelial; signaling; cancer; activation; pathway; apoptosis,cells · expression · gastric

CD4(+) T cell responses are critical for the pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori infection. The present study evaluated the role of the Th17 subset in H. pylori infection. H. pylori infection induced significant expression of IL- and IFN-gamma in mouse gastric tissue. IL- and IL- were increased in the gastric tissue and in H. pylori-stimulated macrophages. Cell responses were examined by intracellular staining for IFN-gamma, IL-, and IL-. Mice infected with H. pylori developed a mixed Th17/Th1 response; Th17 responses preceded Th1 responses. Treatment of mice with an anti-IL- Ab but not a control Ab significantly reduced the H. pylori burden and inflammation in the stomach. H. pylori colonization and gastric inflammation were also lower in IL-(-/-) mice. Furthermore, administration of recombinant adenovirus encoding mouse IL- increased both H. pylori load and inflammation. Further analysis showed that the Th1 cell responses to H. pylori were downregulated when IL- is deficient. These results together suggest that H. pylori infection induces a mixed Th17/Th1 cell response and the Th17/IL- pathway modulates Th1 cell responses and contributes to pathology.', ""Interleukin-21 (IL-21) Downregulates Dendritic Cell Cytokine Responses to Helicobacter pylori and Modulates T Lymphocyte IL-17A Expression in Peyer's Patches during Infection.. Interleukin- (IL-), a cytokine produced by many subsets of activated immune cells, is critical for driving inflammation in several models. Using Helicobacter pylori infection as a model for chronic mucosal infection, we previously published that IL- is required for the development of gastritis in response to infection. Concomitant with protection from chronic inflammation, H. pylori-infected IL--/- mice exhibited limited Th1 and Th17 responses in their gastric mucosa. Here we report that H. pylori-infected IL--/- mice express significantly higher levels of IL-17A than H. pylori-infected wild-type (WT) mice in the Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. This led us to hypothesize that IL- may indirectly regulate H. pylori-specific T cell responses by controlling dendritic cell (DC) functions in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. It was found that IL- treatment reduced the ability of dendritic cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines in response to H. pylori While H. pylori increased the expression of costimulatory proteins on DCs, IL- reduced the expression of CD40 in the presence of H. pylori Also, Th17 recall responses were intact when DCs were used as antigen-presenting cells in the presence of IL-, but IL- did impact the ability of DCs to induce antigen-specific proliferation. These data suggest that IL-, while proinflammatory in most settings, downregulates the proinflammatory cytokine microenvironment through modulating the cytokine expression of DCs, indirectly modifying IL-17A expression. Understanding how these proinflammatory cytokines are regulated will advance our understanding of how and why H. pylori infection may be tolerated in some individuals while it causes gastritis, ulcers, or cancer in others."", 'Involvement of Toll-like receptors on Helicobacter pylori-induced immunity.. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a major role in the innate immune response since they recognize a broad repertoire of PAMPs mainly via Toll-like receptors (TLRs). During Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, TLRs have been shown to be important to control cytokine response particularly in murine DCs. In the present study we analyzed the effect of blocking TLRs on human DCs. Co-incubation of human DCs with H. pylori resulted in the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12p70, IL- and IL-. Release of IL-12p70 and IL- was predominantly influenced when TLR4 signaling was blocked by adding specific antibodies, suggesting a strong influence on subsequent T cell responses through TLR4 activation on DCs. Co-incubation of H. pylori-primed DC with allogeneic CD4+ T cells resulted in the production of IFN-γ and IL-17A as well as the expression of Foxp3, validating a mixed Th1/Th17 and Treg response in vitro. Neutralization of TLR4 during H. pylori infection resulted in significantly decreased amounts of IL-17A and IFN-γ and reduced levels of Foxp3-expressing and IL--secreting T cells. Our findings suggest that DC cytokine secretion induced upon TLR4-mediated recognition of H. pylori influences inflammatory and regulatory T cell responses, which might facilitate the chronic bacterial persistence.']",il; cells; immune; response; expression; mice; responses; macrophages; by; gastric,cells · immune · response

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Numerous medicinal plants have been used traditionally in South Africa for gastric ulcer treatment. Helicobacter pylori is known for causing inflammation and the onset of gastric ulcers. While several studies explored medicinal plants against H. pylori, investigation of medicinal plants used for gastric ulcers has been neglected, as well as the effects these plants would have on bacteria occurring naturally in the gut microbiome. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate Southern African medicinal plants used traditionally for treating gastric ulcers against H. pylori , as well as the effects that these plants have when combined with Lactobacillus species and tested against H. pylori. METHODOLOGY: Based on evidence from the ethnobotanical literature, plants were collected. Their antimicrobial activity was assessed against five clinical H. pylori strains, and in combination with each of three Lactobacillus species, using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) broth microdilution assays. Toxicity was assessed using the brine shrimp lethality assay. RESULTS: Noteworthy activity was observed against at least one H. pylori strain for plant species. The lowest mean MICs were from organic extracts of Carissa edulis Vahl ( mg/mL) and Chironia baccifera L. ( mg/mL), and aqueous extracts of Sansevieria hyacinthoides (L.) Druce ( mg/mL) and Dodonaea viscosa Jacq. ( mg/mL). Aqueous extracts of the investigated plants were combined with Lactobacillus species, and the majority of combinations showed increased antimicrobial activity compared with the extracts alone. Combinations of Lactobacillus rhamnosus with of the aqueous plant extracts showed at least a two-fold decrease in the mean MBC against all H. pylori strains tested. Lactobacillus acidophilus combined with either Protea repens L., Carpobrotus edulis (L.) L. Bolus or Warburgia salutaris (Bertol.f.) Chiov. aqueous extracts had the best anti-H. pylori activity (mean MBCs of mg/mL for each combination). Only four organic and one aqueous extract(s) were considered toxic. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the potential of medicinal plants to inhibit H. pylori growth and their role in traditional treatments for the management of ulcers. The results also indicate that aqueous extracts of these plants do not hinder the growth of bacteria that occur naturally in the gut microbiome and play a role in maintaining gut health, as well as show the potential benefit of including Lactobacillus species as potentiators of H. pylori activity.', 'In vitro activity of neem (Azadirachta indica) oil extract against Helicobacter pylori.. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The neem tree (Azadirachta indica A.Juss), of the Meliaceae family, has been used in India for millennia in traditional medicine. Parts of the tree are used to treat problems with the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and hair; to combat infections of smallpox and plasmodium; and to treat ulcers, diabetes, blood pressure, headache, and heartburn. Natural products and extracts from the tree have been reported to have antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiparasitic activities. AIM OF THE STUDY: Antibiotic resistance in the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is increasing, and novel therapeutics to eradicate this bacterium are needed. Given the growing interest in the use of natural products as antimicrobials, this study was designed to examine the bactericidal effects of an extract of neem oil against H. pylori. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neem oil was obtained from a commercial source and subjected to liquid-liquid extraction with diethyl ether and aqueous methanol; the methanol-soluble fraction was retained. The minimum inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) concentrations were determined against nine strains of H. pylori. Additionally, specific properties of the extract were characterized using H. pylori strain G27: bactericidal kinetics, reversibility, and effectiveness under growth arrest conditions and at low pH. The hemolytic activity of the extract was measured in vitro. RESULTS: The MIC and MBC of the extract against the H. pylori strains were between and µg/mL and - µg/mL, respectively. The bactericidal activity was time- and concentration-dependent, and at the highest concentrations (- µg/mL), no detectable bacteria were present by h. The activity of the extract was reversible, independent of H. pylori growth, and increased at low pH. The extract exhibited no appreciable hemolytic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Neem oil extract has significant bactericidal activity against H. pylori. The extract has several favorable pharmacological properties, including ability to kill non-growing bacteria, increased activity at low pH, and no hemolytic activity. The compound(s) present in the extract could potentially be used as a future treatment for H. pylori infection.', 'Phytochemical composition, antioxidant, antibacterial, and enzyme inhibitory activities of organic extracts from flower buds of Cleistocalyx operculatus (Roxb.)

In this study, we obtained seven solvent extracts from the flower buds and evaluated their total phenolic (TPC), flavonoid (TFC), tannin (TTC), triterpenoid saponin (TSC), and alkaloid (TAC) contents. We assessed antioxidant activities using the DPPH assay and also looked at antimicrobial and enzyme inhibitory effects. The water extract possessed the highest TPC ( mg GAE/g extract), followed by ethanol, methanol, and hexane extracts (- mg GAE/g extract). Chloroform, butanol, ethyl acetate, and ethanol extracts had high TSCs (- mg OAE/g extract). The hexane extract was richest in TTC and TFC ( mg CE/g extract and mg QE/g extract, respectively). Ethanol and methanol extracts exhibited the strongest antioxidant activities (IC50 values of and μg/ml, respectively), followed by the water extract (IC50 of μg/ml). The hexane extract displayed the most growth-inhibitory activity against Helicobacter pylori ATCC51932 and ATCC43504 strains and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC13311 (MIC values of , , and mg/ml, respectively). Moreover, the hexane extract revealed the strongest inhibition of H. pylori urease activity (IC50 of μg/ml), whereas the water and methanol extracts had potent inhibitory effects on α-glucosidase activity (IC50 values of and μg/ml, respectively). These flower bud extracts could be used for health protection, especially in preventing bacterial infections and inhibiting enzymes associated with various human diseases.

The gut microbiota significantly impacts the development and progression of upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, including esophageal and gastric cancers. Microbial dysbiosis contributes to carcinogenesis through mechanisms such as inflammation, immune modulation, and direct DNA damage. Techniques for sampling oral, esophageal, and gastric microbiota vary, with standardization being essential for reliable results. Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) are associated with an enrichment of Gram-negative bacteria, promoting inflammation and cancer progression. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) also shows distinct microbial patterns, with reduced diversity and increased harmful bacteria like Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. In gastric cancer (GC), Helicobacter pylori (HP) and non-HP gastric microbiota play significant roles, with diverse microbial communities contributing to cancer development through nitrate reduction, immune modulation, and inflammation. Emerging evidence highlights the role of non-HP bacteria in promoting carcinogenesis, with specific taxa like Fusobacterium nucleatum and Lactobacillus influencing tumor growth and immune evasion. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex interactions between gut microbiota and upper GI cancers, paving the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Understanding these microbial dynamics offers potential for microbiota-based interventions, improving the early detection, prognosis, and treatment of upper GI cancers. This comprehensive review summarizes the available evidence on the role of microbiota in upper GI oncology and the need for continued exploration in this field."", 'Gastric microbial community profiling reveals a dysbiotic cancer-associated microbiota.. OBJECTIVE: Gastric carcinoma development is triggered by Helicobacter pylori. Chronic H. pylori infection leads to reduced acid secretion, which may allow the growth of a different gastric bacterial community. This change in the microbiome may increase aggression to the gastric mucosa and contribute to malignancy. Our aim was to evaluate the composition of the gastric microbiota in chronic gastritis and in gastric carcinoma. DESIGN: The gastric microbiota was retrospectively investigated in patients with gastric carcinoma and patients with chronic gastritis by 16S rRNA gene profiling, using next-generation sequencing. Differences in microbial composition of the two patient groups were assessed using linear discriminant analysis effect size. Associations between the most relevant taxa and clinical diagnosis were validated by real-time quantitative PCR. Predictive functional profiling of microbial communities was obtained with PICRUSt. RESULTS: The gastric carcinoma microbiota was characterised by reduced microbial diversity, by decreased abundance of Helicobacter and by the enrichment of other bacterial genera, mostly represented by intestinal commensals. The combination of these taxa into a microbial dysbiosis index revealed that dysbiosis has excellent capacity to discriminate between gastritis and gastric carcinoma. Analysis of the functional features of the microbiota was compatible with the presence of a nitrosating microbial community in carcinoma. The major observations were confirmed in validation cohorts from different geographic origins. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed analysis of the gastric microbiota revealed for the first time that patients with gastric carcinoma exhibit a dysbiotic microbial community with genotoxic potential, which is distinct from that of patients with chronic gastritis.', 'Helicobacter pylori infection associates with fecal microbiota composition and diversity..

Anti-H. pylori serology and H. pylori stool antigen tests were used to determine the H. pylori infection status. The fecal microbiota composition of H. pylori positive subjects and matched negative control individuals was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. H. pylori infection was found to be significantly associated with fecal microbiota alterations and a general increase in fecal microbial diversity. In infected individuals, the H. pylori stool antigen load determined a larger portion of the microbial variation than age or sex. The highest H. pylori stool antigen loads were associated with a putatively harmful microbiota composition. This study demonstrates profound alterations in human fecal microbiota of H. pylori infected individuals.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has a variety of clinical outcomes, and host genetic factors play an important role in this process. Cytokines are important factors in mediating and controlling the inflammatory process during H. pylori infection. Interleukin- (IL-) plays a critical role in the epithelial cell response to H. pylori infection and the development of H. pylori-related gastric disorders. The IL- gene has an A/T base pair polymorphism in the promoter region (-), which has been linked to an increase in interleukin production by gastric epithelial cells. In this context, the goal of our study was to determine the polymorphism in the IL- gene and its relation to H. pylori infection and H. pylori-associated gastric diseases. Gastric biopsy specimens were collected from patients with H. pylori infection and patients without H. pylori infection. The rapid urease test and detection of the glmM gene were used to diagnose H. pylori infection. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to identify the polymorphism in the Il- gene (at position-). The presence of the A/A and T/A genotypes of the IL- gene was found to be significantly associated with susceptibility to H. pylori infection (p = and p = , respectively). Also, the IL- A allele was significantly associated with H. pylori infection in our study (p = ).

BACKGROUND: Gastric atrophy induced by Helicobacter pylori is thought to predispose patients to noncardiac gastric cancer development. However, the host genetic factors that influence the progression of gastric atrophy have not been elucidated. In this study, we examined the effects of cytokine polymorphisms on H. pylori-induced gastric atrophy. METHODS: Blood samples were taken from Japanese subjects. The interleukin- (IL-; T-330G), IL- (C-33T), and IL- (C-1111T) polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers (PCR-CTPP). Anti-H. pylori IgG antibody and pepsinogen I and II were measured to diagnose H. pylori infection and atrophic gastritis. RESULTS: The odds ratios (ORs) for the association between IL- polymorphism [OR = , % CI (confidence interval) = - (T/T to G/G)] or IL- polymorphism [OR = , % CI = - (T/C to C/C)] were increased significantly with gastric atrophy, whereas the corresponding OR of IL- polymorphism was decreased with gastric atrophy [OR = , % CI = - (C/T and T/T to C/C)].

BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is comprised of a spectrum of related disorders, including hiatal hernia, reflux disease with its associated symptoms, erosive esophagitis, peptic stricture, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Besides multiple pathophysiological associations among these disorders, they are also characterized by their comorbid occurrence in identical patients and by their similar epidemiologic behavior. The occurrence of GERD is shaped by marked temporal and geographic variations, suggesting the influence of environmental risk factors in the etiology of these diseases. VARIATIONS BY TIME, GEOGRAPHY, AND RACE: Between and , the incidence of GERD and esophageal adenocarcinoma increased fivefold in most Western countries. The incidence of GERD also appears to be rising in the most developed countries of Asia. All severe forms of GERD, such as erosive esophagitis, peptic stricture, Barrett's metaplasia, and esophageal adenocarcinoma, are more common among whites than other ethnic groups. AFFLUENCE AND OBESITY AS RISK FACTORS: Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma tend to occur slightly more often in subjects with higher income. Overweight and obesity contribute to the development of hiatal hernia, increase intra-abdominal pressure, and promote gastroesophageal reflux. Weight gain increases reflux symptoms, whereas weight loss decreases such symptoms. Other risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol, dietary fat, or drugs, play only a minor role in shaping the epidemiologic patterns of GERD. PROTECTION THROUGH HELICOBACTER PYLORI: On a population level, a high prevalence of H. pylori infection is likely to reduce levels of acid secretion and protect some carriers of the infection against reflux disease and its associated complications. Several studies have confirmed a lesser prevalence of H. pylori among subjects with than without GERD. Until recently, populations in Africa and Asia may have been protected against the development of GERD and esophageal adenocarcinoma by their higher prevalence of H. pylori infection.

H. pylori infection rate is generally low in patients with reflux esophagitis or Barrett esophagus. The increase in the incidence of reflux esophagitis after successful eradication of H. pylori has been alleviated by several reports from Western countries. However, temporary appearance or aggravation of reflux esophagitis after H. pylori eradication has been reported in Japan because of acid secretion increases. After long-term follow-up, most of them remain in mild severity of reflux esophagitis, and symptoms may not become more severe. The increase in symptoms of GERD rarely occurs after eradication of H. pylori.

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative, spiral-shaped bacterium that infects approximately % of the world's population and has been strongly associated with chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoma, and gastric cancer. The elimination of H. pylori is currently considered one of the most effective strategies for the treatment of gastric-related diseases, so antibiotic therapy is the most commonly used regimen for the treatment of H. pylori infection. Although this therapy has some positive effects, antibiotic resistance has become another clinically prominent problem. Therefore, the development of a safe and efficient vaccine has become an important measure to prevent H. pylori infection. METHODS: PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched from January to March with search terms-H. pylori vaccine, adjuvants, immunization, pathogenesis, and H. pylori eradication in the title and/or abstract of literature. A total of documents were obtained. Based on the principles of academic reliability, authority, nearly publicated, and excluded the similar documents, finally, documents were selected, organized, and analyzed. RESULTS: Most of the candidate antigens used as H. pylori vaccines in these literatures are whole-cell antigens and virulence antigens such as UreB, VacA, CagA, and HspA, and the main types of vaccines for H. pylori are whole bacteria vaccines, vector vaccines, subunit vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines, epitope vaccines, etc. Some vaccines have shown good immune protection in animal trials; however, few vaccines show good in clinical trials. The only H. pylori vaccine passed phase clinical trial is a recombinant subunit vaccine using Urease subunit B (UreB) as the vaccine antigen, and it shows good prophylactic effects. Meanwhile, the adjuvant system for vaccines against this bacterium has been developed considerably. In addition to the traditional mucosal adjuvants such as cholera toxin (CT) and E. coli heat labile enterotoxin (LT), there are also promising safer and more effective mucosal adjuvants. All these advances made safe and effective H. pylori vaccines come into service as early as possible. CONCLUSIONS: This review briefly summarized the advances of H. pylori vaccines from two aspects, candidates of antigens and adjuvants, to provide references for the development of vaccine against this bacterium. We also present our prospects of exosomal vaccines in H. pylori vaccine research, in the hope of inspiring future researchers."", 'Oral immunization of mice with a multivalent therapeutic subunit vaccine protects against Helicobacter pylori infection.. Helicobacter pylori is a human class I carcinogen and no effective prophylactic or therapeutic H. pylori vaccine has yet been marketed. H. pylori can escape the host immune response, but the precise immune protection mechanisms in humans remain unknown. In this study, we developed a multivalent, subunit H. pylori vaccine candidate by formulating three commonly used H. pylori antigens, neutrophil-activating protein (NAP), urease subunit A (UreA) and subunit B (UreB) with the mucosal adjuvant, a double-mutant heat-labile toxin (dmLT) from Escherichia coli, and evaluated its immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of H. pylori infection. We found that oral immunization of H. pylori-infected mice significantly reduced gastric bacterial colonization at both and weeks after immunization. The reduction in bacterial burdens was accompanied with significantly increased serum antigen-specific IgG responses and mucosal IgA responses. Moreover, oral immunization also induced Th1/Th17 immune responses, which may play a synergistic role with the specific antibodies in the elimination of H. pylori. Thus, our vaccine candidate appears able to overcome the immune evasion mechanism of H. pylori, restore the suppression of Th2 immune responses with the induction of a strong humoral immune response. These results lay the foundation for the development of an optimized oral therapeutic H. pylori vaccine with increased immunogenicity of UreA and UreB, as well as providing long-term immunity.']",vaccine; mice; recombinant; vaccines; against; immunization; immune; protection; vaccination; ureb,vaccine · mice · recombinant

Most available trials have compared the different PPIs at one or a few selected specific dosages, making it difficult to derive quantitative equivalence dosages. Here we derived PPI dose equivalents based on a comprehensive assessment of dose-dependent effects on intragastric pH. METHODS: All available clinical studies reporting the effects of PPIs on mean -h intragastric pH were sought from electronic databases including Medline. Studies included were restricted to those targeting the Caucasian population, and healthy volunteers or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients. The dose-effect relationships for mean -h intragastric pH and for percentage of time with pH > in h were analyzed for each PPI using pharmacodynamic modeling with NONMEM and a model integrating all available data. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Based on the mean -h gastric pH, the relative potencies of the five PPIs compared to omeprazole were , , , , and for pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole, respectively. Compared with healthy volunteers, patients with GERD needed a -fold higher dose and Helicobacter pylori-positive individuals needed only about % of the dose to achieve a given increase in mean -h intragastric pH. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis provides quantitative estimates on clinical potency of individual PPIs that may be helpful when switching between PPIs and for assessing the cost-effectiveness of specific PPIs. However, our estimates must be viewed with caution because only a limited dose range has been tested and not exactly the same study conditions were applied for the different substances.', 'Comparison of the effects of esomeprazole 40 mg, rabeprazole 20 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg, and pantoprazole 40 mg on intragastrıc pH in extensive metabolizer patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Studies on the therapeutic efficacy of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have been recently published. In most of these studies, comparison of only two PPIs have been made. There are few studies on the comparison of four or more PPIs. We aimed to compare the acid inhibitory effects of esomeprazole mg, rabeprazole mg, lansoprazole mg, and pantoprazole mg on days and of treatment in patients with GERD, who were extensive metabolizers in regard to the CYP2C19 genotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Helicobacter pylori-negative with typical symptoms of GERD patients were randomly divided into four treatment groups. Efficacy analysis on days and were performed on the four groups which comprised (esomeprazole), (rabeprazole), (lansoprazole), and (pantoprazole) patients. RESULTS: On day of PPI treatment, the mean percentage of time with intragastric Ph> were %, %, %, and % for the groups, respectively, and on day , these values were %, %, %, and %, respectively. Esomeprazole, rabeprazole, and lansoprazole were found to be superior to pantoprazole on the first day of treatment. CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole is a less potent proton pump inhibitor than the other PPIs tested on the first day of treatment. When the time needed to raise the intragatric pH to over was evaluated, esomeprazole was found to have the most rapid action, followed by lansoprazole and rabeprazole.']",ppi; ppis; pump; proton; ph; acid; mg; esomeprazole; inhibitors; reflux,ppi · ppis · pump

Helicobacter pylori infects more than half of the world's population. Although most patients are asymptomatic, persistent infection may cause chronic gastritis and gastric cancer. Adhesion of the bacteria to the gastric mucosa is a necessary prerequisite for the pathogenesis of H. pylori-related diseases and is mediated by mucin O-glycans. In order to define which glycans may be implicated in the binding of the bacteria to the gastric mucosa in humans, we have characterized the exact pattern of glycosylation of gastric mucins. We have identified that the major component was always a core -based glycan carrying two blood group H antigens, whatever was the blood group of individuals. We have also demonstrated that around % of O-glycans carried blood group A, B or H antigens, suggesting that the variation of gastric mucin glycosylation between individuals is partly due to the blood group status. This study will help better understanding the role of O-glycans in the physiology and homeostasis of gastric mucosa. Overall, the results reported here give us the necessary background information to begin studies to determine whether individuals who express certain carbohydrate epitopes on specific mucins are predisposed to certain gastric diseases."", 'Helicobacter pylori adhesion to gastric epithelial cells is mediated by glycan receptors.. Helicobacter pylori adhesion to gastric epithelial cells constitutes a key step in the establishment of a successful infection of the gastric mucosa. The high representation of outer membrane proteins in the bacterial genome suggests the relevance of those proteins in the establishment of profitable interactions with the host gastric cells. Gastric epithelial cells are protected by a mucous layer gel, mainly consisting of the MUC5AC and MUC6 mucins. In addition to this protective role, mucins harbor glycan-rich domains that constitute preferential binding sites of many pathogens. In this article we review the main players in the process of H. pylori adhesion to gastric epithelial cells, which contribute decisively to the high prevalence and chronicity of H. pylori infection. The BabA adhesin recognizes both H-type and Lewis b blood-group antigens expressed on normal gastric mucosa of secretor individuals, contributing to the initial steps of infection. Upon colonization, persistent infection induces an inflammatory response with concomitant expression of sialylated antigens. The SabA adhesin mediates H. pylori binding to inflamed gastric mucosa by recognizing sialyl-Lewis a and sialyl-Lewis x antigens. The expression of the BabA and SabA adhesins is tightly regulated, permitting the bacteria to rapidly adapt to the changes of glycosylation of the host gastric mucosa that occur during infection, as well as to escape from the inflammatory response. The growing knowledge of the interactions between the bacterial adhesins and the host receptors will contribute to the design of alternative strategies for eradication of the infection.', 'Adhesion of Helicobacter Species to the Human Gastric Mucosa: A Deep Look Into Glycans Role.. Helicobacter species infections may be associated with the development of gastric disorders, such as gastritis, peptic ulcers, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and gastric carcinoma. Binding of these bacteria to the gastric mucosa occurs through the recognition of specific glycan receptors expressed by the host epithelial cells. This review addresses the state of the art knowledge on these host glycan structures and the bacterial adhesins involved in Helicobacter spp. adhesion to gastric mucosa colonization. Glycans are expressed on every cell surface and they are crucial for several biological processes, including protein folding, cell signaling and recognition, and host-pathogen interactions. Helicobacter pylori is the most predominant gastric Helicobacter species in humans. The adhesion of this bacterium to glycan epitopes present on the gastric epithelial surface is a crucial step for a successful colonization. Major adhesins essential for colonization and infection are the blood-group antigen-binding adhesin (BabA) which mediates the interaction with fucosylated H-type and Lewis B glycans, and the sialic acid-binding adhesin (SabA) which recognizes the sialyl-Lewis A and X glycan antigens. Since not every H. pylori strain expresses functional BabA or SabA adhesins, other bacterial proteins are most probably also involved in this adhesion process, including LabA (LacdiNAc-binding adhesin), which binds to the LacdiNAc motif on MUC5AC mucin. Besides H. pylori, several other gastric non-Helicobacter pylori Helicobacters (NHPH), mainly associated with pigs (H. suis) and pets (H. felis, H. bizzozeronii, H. salomonis, and H. heilmannii), may also colonize the human stomach and cause gastric disease, including gastritis, peptic ulcers and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. These NHPH lack homologous to the major known adhesins involved in colonization of the human stomach. In humans, NHPH infection rate is much lower than in the natural hosts. Differences in the glycosylation profile between gastric human and animal mucins acting as glycan receptors for NHPH-associated adhesins, may be involved. The identification and characterization of the key molecules involved in the adhesion of gastric Helicobacter species to the gastric mucosa is important to understand the colonization and infection strategies displayed by different members of this genus.']",mucin; lewis; lps; binding; mucins; baba; fl; glycosylation; the; lipopolysaccharide,mucin · lewis · lps

Dyspepsia is a syndrome consisting of epigastric pain, burning, fullness, discomfort, early satiety, nausea, vomiting and belching. Functional dyspepsia (FD) is diagnosed if upper gastrointestinal endoscopy does not show structural abnormality explaining these symptoms. %-% and %-% of Asian people suffer from of uninvestigated dyspepsia and FD, respectively. Most patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia are found to have FD. Patients with FD are usually young and there is no predilection to any gender. Overlap of FD with other functional bowel diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease is common in Asia. Cultural difference in reporting of symptoms of dyspepsia is well-known. Moreover, dietary factors, socio-cultural and psychological issues, gastrointestinal infection including that caused by Helicobacter pylori, frequency of organic diseases such as peptic ulcer and gastric cancer responsible for dyspeptic symptoms in the study population may also influence epidemiology of dyspepsia. There is considerable heterogeneity in the above issues among different Asian countries. More studies on epidemiology of FD are needed in Asia.', 'Functional dyspepsia in children.. Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a widely prevalent problem in pediatrics, reportedly occurring in % to % of children and accounting for considerable impact on quality of life and health care costs. FD is defined by the Rome III classification as persistent upper abdominal pain or discomfort, not related to bowel movements, and without an organic cause, that is present for at least months prior to diagnosis. Abnormal sensory perception, motor dysfunction, and psychosocial factors have been implicated in the causation of FD. Hypersensitivity to gastric distension, delayed gastric emptying, antral hypomotility, and gastric dysrhythmia are some abnormalities that have been noted in FD. Diagnosis of FD is based on a thorough history and examination, and an appropriate selection of tests based on clinical judgment, the presence of alarm signs, and response to treatment. A positive diagnosis of FD helps to shift focus from further testing to treatment of symptoms. The majority of children with dyspepsia do not have mucosal lesions on endoscopy; hence, endoscopy is not mandatory for the diagnosis of FD. Helicobacter pylori is an uncommon cause of dyspepsia in children, and test and treat strategy is discouraged. Delayed gastric emptying may be present in up to % of children with dyspepsia. A biopsychosocial approach to treatment involving medications, psychological and social supports, and complementary therapies is advocated. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and prokinetics are commonly used first-line medications. PPIs are preferred when epigastric pain is the predominant symptom, whereas prokinetics may be chosen when postprandial fullness or early satiety is the main symptom. PPIs may be more efficacious and cost-effective than H2 blockers according to adult data.', 'Effect of Helicobacter pylori Eradication on Functional Dyspepsia.. BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study evaluated the effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication on functional dyspepsia (FD), and the relationship between the changes of histological gastritis and FD symptom responses.

H. pylori tests and gastritis grade by the Sydney system were performed before and year after the proton pump based-eradication therapy for days. Serum levels of pepsinogen, and genetic polymorphisms IL-, IL- and IL- were investigated. RESULTS: Total of patients completed the year follow-up. When the response rate of dyspepsia was compared at year between the non-eradicated group (n = ) and eradicated group (n = ), each group showed complete response of % and %; satisfactory response (≥ %) of % and %; partial response (< %) of % and %; and refractory response of % and %, respectively (P = ). In addition, the responder group (complete + satisfactory response) at year showed improvement of activity and chronic inflammation in both the antrum and corpus (all P < ).

This work focused on the development of mucoadhesive and floating chitosan-coated alginate beads as a gastroretensive delivery vehicle for amoxicillin, towards the effective eradication of Helicobacter pylori, a major causative agent of peptic ulcers. Alginate was used as the core bead core polymer and chitosan as the mucoadhesive polymer coating. Amoxicillin-loaded alginate beads coated with % (w/v) chitosan (ALG/%CHI) exhibited excellent floating ability, high encapsulation efficiency, high drug loading capacity, and a strong in vitro mucoadhesion to the gastric mucosal layer. In vitro, amoxicillin was released faster in simulated gastric fluid (pH , HCl) than in simulated intestinal fluid (phosphate buffer, pH ). ALG/%CHI could be prepared with a > % drug encapsulation efficiency and exhibited more than % muco-adhesiveness, % floating ability, and achieved sustained release of amoxicillin for over six hours in SGF.', 'Preparation and characterization of floating drug delivery system of azithromycin.. The objective of present study was to develop a stomach drug delivery system of azithromycin (AZH) as a model drug for eradication of Helicobacter pyloni (H. pylori). Floating microspheres of AZH were prepared by the solvent evaporation method. The prepared microspheres were subjected to evaluation for particle size, incorporation efficiency, in vitro buoyancy and in vitro drug release characteristics. The formulations were prepared at a variable stirring rate ( to rpm) and temperature (- degrees C). Surface morphology characteristics were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mean particle size of the microspheres significantly increased with increasing polymer concentration and was in the range +/- to +/- microm. Angle of repose was between to degrees. Tapped density ranged between to g/cm3. The compressibility index of all formulations was found to be in the range of to %, which was < indicating good flow characteristics. The encapsulation efficiency of the prepared microspheres was in the range of +/- to +/- %. The physical state of the drug, before and after formulation was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Percentage buoyancy of the microspheres was in the range +/- to +/- % for h. In vitro drug release studies were performed in simulated gastrointestinal fluid (SGF), pH as dissolution medium ( mL) for h. Effects of stirring rate during preparation, polymer concentration and temperature on the size of microspheres and drug release were also observed.

OBJECTIVES: There are various obstacles in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infections, including low antibiotic levels and poor accessibility of the drug at the site of the infection. This study describes the preparation and characterisation of novel floating mucoadhesive alginate beads loaded with clarithromycin for delivery to the gastric mucosa to improve the eradication of this microorganism. METHODS: Calcium alginate beads were prepared by ionotropic gelation. The formulation was modified through addition of oil and coating with chitosan to improve floating, mucoadhesion and modify drug release. KEY FINDINGS: Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the sphericity of the beads with X-ray microtomography showing the three-dimensional structure of the beads with the layered internal structure of the bead and the even distribution of the drug within the bead. This formulation combined two gastro-retentive strategies, and produced excellent in-vitro floating, mucoadhesive and drug release characteristics. Enhanced stability of the beads in phosphate buffer raises a potential for the modified formulations to be targeted to regions of higher pH within the gastrointestinal tract. Drug release from these beads was sustained through an unstirred mucin layer simulating in-vivo conditions under which the H. pylori resides in the gastric mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: This novel formulation will ensure retention for a longer period in the stomach than conventional formulations and control drug release, ensuring high local drug concentrations, leading to improved eradication of the bacteria.']",drug; nanoparticles; release; delivery; floating; microspheres; chitosan; mucoadhesive; prepared; vitro,drug · nanoparticles · release

Helicobacter pylori infects human stomach and cause various gastric diseases including gastric cancer. The species is also known for rapid evolution and wide geographical diversity of genome sequence. Our team sequenced whole genome sequences of H. pylori strains isolated from Japanese patients and compared with whole genome sequences of H. pylori strains with other geographic origin and found that not only the gene repertoire but also genome structures and epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylations had large diversity with various mechanisms. Genome inversion events were geography specific and some of them were found to occur with gene duplication at their termini. DNA methylation states of H. pylori genomes suggested that they are diversified by both existence/absence repertoire of methyltransferase genes and by the movement of target recognition domain in the methyltransferase genes. Omics analysis revealed that methylation target sequence and transcriptome status are actually diversified by the domain sequence movement. We suggested that H. pylori utilizes these genome structure and methylome diversity for its adaptive evolution.', 'Whole-Genome Sequencing and Comparative Genomics of Three Helicobacter pylori Strains Isolated from the Stomach of a Patient with Adenocarcinoma.. Helicobacter pylori is a common pathogen associated with several severe digestive diseases. Although multiple virulence factors have been described, it is still unclear the role of virulence factors on H. pylori pathogenesis and disease progression. Whole genome sequencing could help to find genetic markers of virulence strains. In this work, we analyzed three complete genomes from isolates obtained at the same point in time from a stomach of a patient with adenocarcinoma, using multiple available bioinformatics tools. The genome analysis of the strains B508A-S1, B508A-T2A and B508A-T4 revealed that they were cagA, babA and sabB/hopO negative. The differences among the three genomes were mainly related to outer membrane proteins, methylases, restriction modification systems and flagellar biosynthesis proteins. The strain B508A-T2A was the only one presenting the genotype vacA s1, and had the most distinct genome as it exhibited fewer shared genes, higher number of unique genes, and more polymorphisms were found in this genome. With all the accumulated information, no significant differences were found among the isolates regarding virulence and origin of the isolates. Nevertheless, some B508A-T2A genome characteristics could be linked to the pathogenicity of H. pylori.', 'Strain-specific genes of Helicobacter pylori: genome evolution driven by a novel type IV secretion system and genomic island transfer.. The availability of multiple bacterial genome sequences has revealed a surprising extent of variability among strains of the same species. The human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is known as one of the most genetically diverse species. We have compared the genome sequence of the duodenal ulcer strain P12 and six other H. pylori genomes to elucidate the genetic repertoire and genome evolution mechanisms of this species. In agreement with previous findings, we estimate that the core genome comprises about genes and that H. pylori possesses an open pan-genome. Strain-specific genes are preferentially located at potential genome rearrangement sites or in distinct plasticity zones, suggesting two different mechanisms of genome evolution. The P12 genome contains three plasticity zones, two of which encode type IV secretion systems and have typical features of genomic islands. We demonstrate for the first time that one of these islands is capable of self-excision and horizontal transfer by a conjugative process. We also show that excision is mediated by a protein of the XerD family of tyrosine recombinases. Thus, in addition to its natural transformation competence, conjugative transfer of genomic islands has to be considered as an important source of genetic diversity in H. pylori.']",genome; genes; strains; genomes; sequences; genomic; sequence; genetic; from; human,genome · genes · strains

METHODS: In this retrospective study, in vitro activity of isolated H. pylori in Israel was tested against metronidazole, clarithromycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, and levofloxacin in isolates: from treatment failures and from naïve untreated patients. The minimal inhibitory concentration values were determined according to the Etest instructions. Treatment failures previously failed at least one treatment regimen. RESULTS: No resistance to amoxicillin and tetracycline was detected. Resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin was high in H. pylori isolates both from treated and untreated patients: %, % for metronidazole (P = ); %, % for clarithromycin (P = ), respectively. Dual resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole was seen in % and %, respectively (P = ). Resistance to levofloxacin was detected in two (%) isolates from treated patients.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of antibiotic resistance varies in geographic areas. The information on the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in our local setting is therefore relevant as a guide for the treatment options. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine the primary resistance rates among H. pylori isolated from Malaysian patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biopsy samples were obtained from the stomach antrum and corpus of patients from September until . H. pylori isolated from these patients were then subjected to minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) determination using E-test method, against metronidazole, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, and tetracycline. RESULTS: From patients, were positive for H. pylori where a total of strains were isolated. The resistance rates were noted to be % (metronidazole), % (clarithromycin), % (levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin), and % (amoxicillin and tetracycline).

Resistance to one type of antibiotic was observed in % of the strains where mono-resistance to metronidazole was the most common. Resistance to ≥ antibiotics was noted in % of isolates. High metronidazole MICs of ≥ μg/mL were observed among the resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: The resistance rates of the antibiotics used in primary treatment of H. pylori infections in Malaysia are low, and multi-antibiotic-resistant strains are uncommon.

The objectives of this paper were (i) to determine the presence of H. pylori in the oral cavity and (ii) to examine the relationship between oral H. pylori and subsequent gastritis. Gastric biopsies, saliva samples and dental plaques were obtained from dyspeptic adults.

Gastric MALT lymphoma (GML) is directly caused by Helicobacter pylori infection but occurs only in a small number of infected subjects. Mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of GML remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are now considered as major players in inflammation and carcinogenesis, acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Previous laboratory studies have shown in a GML mouse model that overexpression of a distinct set of five miRNAs (miR-21a, miR-135b, miR-142a, miR-, miR-) could play a critical role in the pathogenesis of GML. Our goal was to compare the miRNA expression profile obtained in the GML mouse model to that in human GML ( cases of GML compared to cases of gastritis control population). RTqPCR on the five dysregulated miRNAs in the GML mouse model and PCR array followed by RTqPCR confirmation showed that four miRNAs were up-regulated (miR-, miR-, miR-196a, miR-) and two miRNAs down-regulated (miR-, miR-) in the stomachs of GML patients vs. gastritis control population.

Finally, the presence of miR-, miR- and miR- in the plasma was validated in GC patients and healthy control subjects, and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of these miRNAs were analyzed. RESULTS: We found that the plasma levels of miR- (P<) and miR- (P<) were significantly higher in GC patients than in healthy controls, while miR- (P<) was significantly lower. The ROC analyses yielded the AUC values of for miR-, for miR- and for miR-, and combined ROC analysis revealed the highest AUC value of in discriminating GC patients from healthy controls. Moreover, the plasma levels of miR- (P<) and miR- (P = ) were significantly higher in GC patients with stage I than in healthy controls. Furthermore, the plasma levels of miR- were significantly higher in GC patients with helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection than those without (P = ), and significantly higher in healthy control subjects with Hp infection than those without (P = ).

Aberrant methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions can permanently inactivate tumor-suppressor genes, as mutations and chromosomal abnormalities do. In gastric cancers, CDKN2A, CDH1, and MLH1 are inactivated more frequently by aberrant methylation than by mutations, and novel tumor-suppressor genes inactivated by promoter methylation are being identified. We recently found that Helicobacter pylori (HP), a potent gastric carcinogen, induces aberrant methylation in gastric mucosae. When a panel of CpG islands was examined, some CpG islands were consistently methylated in gastric mucosae of individuals with HP infection, while others were resistant. The amount of methylated DNA molecules in the gastric mucosae (methylation level) fluctuated while active HP infection was present, but decreased after it was no longer present. Among individuals without active HP infection, methylation levels in the gastric mucosae were higher in individuals with gastric cancers than in those without. DNA methylation is emerging as a promising marker for past exposure to carcinogens and future risk of cancers.', 'Persistence of a component of DNA methylation in gastric mucosae after Helicobacter pylori eradication.. BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection potently induces aberrant DNA methylation in gastric mucosae, and its accumulation is associated with gastric cancer risk. Cross-sectional analysis of methylation levels (fraction of methylated DNA molecules) and temporal analysis of methylation incidence suggested that methylation levels decrease after HP infection discontinues. We aimed to demonstrate the decrease in methylation levels. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with HP infection who had undergone curative endoscopic resection and healthy volunteers were recruited. Methylation levels were quantified by real-time methylation-specific PCR. Histology was evaluated according to the updated Sydney System. RESULTS: In the patients with successful eradication, the FLNc methylation level, along with infiltration of inflammatory cells, decreased from to % at weeks (P = ) and remained low at year. The THBD methylation level (%) remained high at weeks, but decreased to % at year (P = ). Nine healthy volunteers with successful eradication tended to show a decrease of both FLNc and THBD at weeks. However, the methylation levels after the decrease were still higher than those of healthy individuals without HP infection. In the patients with persistent infection, the methylation levels remained the same. Before eradication, the THBD methylation level correlated with the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration (P < ). CONCLUSIONS: Methylation levels in gastric mucosae decreased to certain levels after HP eradication in profiles unique to individual markers. Involvement of chronic inflammation in methylation induction was suggested.', 'The presence of a methylation fingerprint of Helicobacter pylori infection in human gastric mucosae.. Aberrant DNA methylation is deeply involved in human cancers, but its inducers and targets are still mostly unclear. Helicobacter pylori infection was recently shown to induce aberrant methylation in gastric mucosae, and produce a predisposed field for cancerization. Here, we analyzed the presence of target genes in methylation induction by H. pylori and the mechanism for the gene specificity. Noncancerous gastric mucosae were collected from groups of individuals (with and without a gastric cancer, and with and without current H. pylori infection; N = for each group), and methylation of promoter CpG islands of genes that can be methylated in gastric cancer cell lines was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR. In total, genes were consistently methylated in individuals with current or past infection by H. pylori, whereas genes were not methylated at all. In addition, genes were randomly or intermediately methylated in individuals with gastric cancers and the remaining gene was methylated in all the cases. The methylation-susceptible genes had significantly lower mRNA expression levels than the methylation-resistant genes. H. pylori infection did not induce mRNA and protein expression of DNA methyltransferases; DNMT1, DNMT3A or DNMT3B. Gene specificity was present in the induction of aberrant DNA methylation by H. pylori infection, and low mRNA expression, which could precede methylation, was one of the mechanisms for the gene specificity. These findings open up the possibility that a methylation fingerprint can be used as a novel marker for past exposure to a specific carcinogenic factor.']",methylation; dna; cpg; promoter; epigenetic; gc; hypermethylation; gastric; genes; cancer,methylation · dna · cpg

The objective of the present study was to investigate whether there is any difference between pepsinogen levels in Helicobacter pylori-positive and -negative patients with atrophic gastritis, and to analyze the relationship between histopathology and pepsinogen levels after treatment in H. pylori-positive patients with atrophic gastritis. METHODS: The study enrolled a total of cases with atrophic gastritis ( H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative). The H. pylori-positive cases received a one-week eradication treatment. Initially for all and after the treatment for H. pylori-positive cases, serum pepsinogen I and II levels, anti-H. pylori IgG titration and histopathologic analysis were carried out. RESULTS: In the H. pylori-positive patients with atrophic gastritis, the levels of pepsinogen I and pepsinogen I/II ratio were lower while the levels of pepsinogen II were higher compared to the H. pylori-negative patients (p< for all).

Serum levels of pepsinogen (PG) are known to be excellent markers for evaluating the degree of atrophic gastritis. We investigated whether chronic gastritis could be diagnosed by evaluating serum PG levels. METHODS: A total of patients (average age, years; men) were included in this study.

Serum anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) immunoglobulin G (IgG), PGI and PG II were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gastric atrophy and gastric cancer were diagnosed by endoscopy and histopathological examinations. Odds ratios and %CIs were calculated using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Rates of H. pylori infection remained high in Northeastern China. Rates of H. pylori IgG positivity were greater in the gastric cancer and gastric atrophy groups compared to the control group (% and % vs %, P < ). Higher levels of PG II ( μg/L and μg/L vs μg/L, P < ) and lower PGI/PG II ratio ( and vs , P < ) were found in patients with gastric cancer or gastric atrophy compared to healthy controls, whereas no correlation was found between the plasma PGI concentration and risk of gastric cancer (P = ). In addition, multivariate logistic analysis indicated that H. pylori infection and atrophic gastritis were independent risk factors for gastric cancer. Lower plasma PGI/PG II ratio was associated with higher risks of atrophy and gastric cancer. Furthermore, plasma PG II level significantly correlated with H. pylori-infected gastric cancer. CONCLUSION: Serum PG II concentration and PGI/PG II ratio are potential biomarkers for H. pylori-infected gastric disease.

Hemoglobin and ferritin levels, H. pylori stool antigen test and ()C urea breath test were measured in children aged -- years (median years).

All the children received anti-H. pylori combination therapy consisting of amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and lansoprazole. Hemoglobin and MCV values rose significantly compared with baseline values after H. pylori eradication without iron supplementation in children with IDA (p= and p=, respectively).

INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract (upper GI) with macroscopic and histopathological evaluation provides essential tool to differentiate the organic and functional causes of dyspepsia. The distinction, however, is often smooth and not fully defined. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and type of the macroscopic and histopathological changes in the upper GI endoscopy in patients with symptoms of dyspepsia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on patients with dyspepsia, at the age of - years, including patients to years of age (group I) and patients older than (group II) who underwent gastroscopy. The severity of esophagitis was classified according to the Los Angeles Classification and gastritis according the updated Sydney system.

Our results indicate that H. pylori genotype is more relevant than density for oxidative DNA damage.', 'Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress: the smoking gun for Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric cancer?. Helicobacter pylori is the leading risk factor associated with gastric carcinogenesis. H. pylori leads to chronic inflammation because of the failure of the host to eradicate the infection. Chronic inflammation leads to oxidative stress, deriving from immune cells and from within gastric epithelial cells. This is a main contributor to DNA damage, apoptosis and neoplastic transformation. Both pathogen and host factors directly contribute to oxidative stress, including H. pylori virulence factors, and pathways involving DNA damage and repair, polyamine synthesis and metabolism, and oxidative stress response. Our laboratory has recently uncovered a mechanism by which polyamine oxidation by spermine oxidase causes H 2O release, DNA damage and apoptosis. Our studies indicate novel targets for therapeutic intervention and risk assessment in H. pylori-induced gastric cancer. More studies addressing the many potential contributors to oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and gastric carcinogenesis are essential for development of therapeutics and identification of gastric cancer biomarkers.', ""Reactive oxygen species and gastric carcinogenesis: The complex interaction between Helicobacter pylori and host.. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a highly successful human pathogen that colonizes stomach in around % of the global population. The colonization of bacterium induces an inflammatory response and a substantial rise in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), mostly derived from host neutrophils and gastric epithelial cells, which play a crucial role in combating bacterial infections. However, H. pylori has developed various strategies to quench the deleterious effects of ROS, including the production of antioxidant enzymes, antioxidant proteins as well as blocking the generation of oxidants. The host's inability to eliminate H. pylori infection results in persistent ROS production. Notably, excessive ROS can disrupt the intracellular signal transduction and biological processes of the host, incurring chronic inflammation and cellular damage, such as DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation.

METHODS: A()C urea breath test for H. pylori infection was performed in a cohort of consecutive patients with ITP. Patients who tested positive received standard eradication therapy if their platelet count was < x ()/L or if they had symptoms of dyspepsia. RESULTS: H. pylori infection was detected in patients (%), and was not associated with dyspepsia or other clinical or laboratory features. Eradication therapy was successfully administered to patients. Platelet responses were observed in (%) of these patients, which lasted for more than year in patients. Duration of ITP was shorter among responders than nonresponders. Only one response was observed among patients with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < x ()/L). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with ITP is similar to that found in the general population. Infection is not associated with distinctive features of the disease.

METHODS: In this case-control study, diabetic patients (as the target group) refer to the Endocrinology Clinic of Tabriz Educational and Treatment Center, Tabriz northwestern Iran and non-diabetic patients (as the control group) from the group of children referring to the GI Clinic of the same center were enrolled in and . Then H. pylori infection was assessed in two groups using measuring antibody (IgG) and stool antigen (HpSA). RESULTS: H. pylori infection tests were positive in (%) diabetic patients and in (%) in non-diabetic patients (P=). There was a meaningful correlation between the frequency of H. pylori and the longer the duration of diabetes (P<). No correlation was seen between H. pylori infection and other factors such as age of the patients (P=), HbA1C level (P=), age at which diabetes was diagnosed (P=), average daily dosage of insulin (P=), and presence of GI symptoms (P=). CONCLUSIONS: Type diabetic children especially cases with the longer duration of diabetes, are at risk acquiring H. pylori infection. Therefore, screening of H. pylori infection is helpful on the follow up of these patients.', 'Helicobacter pylori infection and diabetes: is it a myth or fact?. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is one of the most common human bacterial pathogens, and infection causes a wide array of gastric disorders, including simple gastritis, peptic ulcers and gastric malignancies. Gastrointestinal inflammation caused by H. pylori can influence the absorption of glucose and lipids, which are also abnormal in diabetes mellitus. Type diabetes mellitus (T2DM), formerly known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or adult-onset diabetes, is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by high levels of blood glucose resulting from insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. It is an emerging pandemic and is rapidly becoming a serious threat to public health. Emerging data now indicate a strong relationship between H. pylori infection and the incidence of T2DM. The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of diabetes are complex, involving insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, insulin secretion deficiency as a result of pancreas β-cell dysfunction, glucotoxicity, and lipotoxicity. H. pylori infection is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, and the growing awareness of its role in diabetes is important for the early detection of glucose dysregulation and prevention of T2DM in high-risk communities. This review probes the possible relationship between H. pylori and diabetes according to epidemiological surveys and discusses putative mechanisms underlying this correlation.', 'Association between type 2 diabetes mellitus and Helicobacter pylori infection.. BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is well known that patients with diabetes mellitus are more prone to infection. In patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic infections are frequent and severe, due to the impairment of their immune status. The aim of this study was to determine the association between Helicobacter pylori infection and type diabetes mellitus in the United Arab Emirates population. This is a case and control study comparison of type diabetes mellitus and non-diabetic groups. The study was conducted at the primary health care clinics in United Arab Emirates during the period from June to August . The study included type diabetes mellitus patients and non-diabetic subjects. METHODS: Helicobacter pylori was assessed by histopathological examination by measuring antibody profiles (IgG and IgA) among type diabetes mellitus patients and the non-diabetic group. RESULTS: The mean age of type diabetes mellitus patients infected with Helicobacter pylori was +/- years compared to +/- years in the non-diabetic infected subjects. A positive antibody titer for Helicobacter pylori infection (IgA >or=) was found in % of the diabetic subjects compared to % of the non-diabetic subjects (p<). There was higher prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in diabetic obese patients than the non-diabetic subjects (% vs %, p<).

AIM: Controversy exists concerning the relation between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and coronary artery disease (CAD). We aimed to examine the relationship between HP infection and severity of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with chronic CAD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of patients ( [%] men; mean age ± years) scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery were consecutively enrolled in the cross-sectional study. According to rapid urease test and/or gastric biopsy samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin and according to Giemsa, patients were classified as HP positive (n=; %) or HP negative (n=; %). Coronary angiograms were scored by quantitative assessment, using multiple angiographic scoring system: ) vessel score (number of coronary arteries stenosed ≥%), ) Gensini score (assigning a severity score to each coronary stenosis according to the degree of luminal narrowing and its topographic importance) and ) angiographic severity score (number of coronary artery segments stenosed ≥%). RESULTS: In comparison to HP-negative patients, HP-positive patients were more frequently hypertensive (P=), had higher values of systolic (P=) and diastolic (P=) blood pressure and total cholesterol (P=) and had lower values of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C; P=).

BACKGROUND: The role of infection in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is still a matter of debate. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the effect of CagA-positive Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) strains infection on coronary atherosclerosis in patients with coronary heart disease and to elucidate how cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA)-positive H. pylori strains infections were involved in coronary heart disease by examining the levels of serum lipid, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and oxidized low-density protein (oxLDL). METHODS: Recruited for this study were patients with coronary heart disease. The severity of coronary heart disease was estimated by calculating the Gensini score. Serum oxLDL and hsCRP were examined in all subjects. Current H. pylori infection was determined in all participants by means of a modified (13C) urea breath test (> dpm classified as positive). IgG antibodies against CagA protein were analyzed by enzyme immunoassays. Antibody titers against CagA (≥ U/ml) were classified as positive. All subjects were divided into three groups, including an uninfected group (n=), an H. pylori +CagA- group (n=), and an H. pylori +CagA+ group (n=).

The levels of total cholesterol, LDL, apolipoprotein B, serum hsCRP, oxLDL were significantly elevated and the severity of coronary atherosclerosis was significantly increased in H. pylori +CagA+ group (p<). CONCLUSIONS: More serious coronary atherosclerosis was observed in CHD patients with H. pylori +CagA+ infection. H. pylori +CagA+ infection might be involved in coronary atherosclerosis by modifying serum lipids, enhancing LDL oxidation, and activating the inflammatory responses.', 'Helicobacter pylori infection in coronary artery disease.. The role of inflammation in the pathogenesis and progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) has been increasingly discussed, but still remains unclear. Inflammatory changes in the vessel wall play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Systemic inflammatory reaction can be detected by showing increased plasma levels of different proinflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins. Infectious agents have been linked to coronary heart disease on epidemiological and pathogenetic grounds. The prevalent condition and the exact mechanism of initiation of atherosclerotic vascular disease remain unclear. Nevertheless, many similarities exist between the processes of inflammation and atherogenesis, and the evidence is growing for the role of an active inflammation in the atherosclerosis in the coronary circulation and elsewhere. Although the seroepidemiological and eradication studies have suggested a causal relationship between Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and coronary heart disease; the issue is still controversial. The detection of Hp specific DNA in atheromatous plaque material from coronary arteries, but more important, the reduction in restenosis of coronary vessels after Hp eradication could be interpreted as an evidence for the involvement of a Hp infection in the progression of CAD induced by a local inflammatory process.']",atherosclerosis; coronary; stroke; carotid; cardiovascular; risk; chd; heart; af; infection,atherosclerosis · coronary · stroke

Helicobacter pylori is a spiral-shaped bacterium, which plays a role in the aetiology of gastric diseases in humans. Non-H. pylori Helicobacter (NHPH) species naturally colonise the stomach of animals and also induce gastric lesions in humans, highlighting their zoonotic importance. We evaluated the gastric bacterial colonisation density and gastric lesions and sought to identify the main phylogenetic groups of the Helicobacter spp. obtained from dogs in the central region of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, with this study aiming to investigate the occurrence of Helicobacter spp. in saliva and gastric samples from these dogs. This study included dogs and used analysis such as cytology, histopathology, PCR, rapid urease testing, and phylogenetic analysis. Of the dogs, % were positive for Helicobacter spp., and these bacteria were present in the stomach of dogs and saliva of eight. Respectively, eight, , and nine dogs had mild, moderate, and severe colonisation. Lymphocytic-plasmacytic infiltrate was the main gastric lesion. However, the presence of Helicobacter and the density appeared to be unrelated to the gastric lesions. The samples possessed a high nucleotide identity with remarkably similar sequences among some of the species of NHPH such as H. heilmannii s.s., H. salomonis, H. felis, and H. bizzozeronii. The saliva of domestic dogs, even of those who appear clinically healthy, can cause Helicobacter infection in humans and other animals, with, in these dogs, increased density, occurrence rate, and predominance of NHPH of zoonotic importance being found in the stomach with a lower occurrence of Helicobacter spp. in the saliva.', 'Gastric Helicobacter species associated with dogs, cats and pigs: significance for public and animal health.. This article focuses on the pathogenic significance of Helicobacter species naturally colonizing the stomach of dogs, cats and pigs. These gastric ""non-Helicobacter (H.) pylori Helicobacter species"" (NHPH) are less well-known than the human adapted H. pylori. Helicobacter suis has been associated with gastritis and decreased daily weight gain in pigs. Several studies also attribute a role to this pathogen in the development of hyperkeratosis and ulceration of the non-glandular stratified squamous epithelium of the pars oesophagea of the porcine stomach. The stomach of dogs and cats can be colonized by several Helicobacter species but their pathogenic significance for these animals is probably low. Helicobacter suis as well as several canine and feline gastric Helicobacter species may also infect humans, resulting in gastritis, peptic and duodenal ulcers, and low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. These agents may be transmitted to humans most likely through direct or indirect contact with dogs, cats and pigs. Additional possible transmission routes include consumption of water and, for H. suis, also consumption of contaminated pork. It has been described that standard H. pylori eradication therapy is usually also effective to eradicate the NHPH in human patients, although acquired antimicrobial resistance may occasionally occur and porcine H. suis strains are intrinsically less susceptible to aminopenicillins than non-human primate H. suis strains and other gastric Helicobacter species. Virulence factors of H. suis and the canine and feline gastric Helicobacter species include urease activity, motility, chemotaxis, adhesins and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. These NHPH, however, lack orthologs of cytotoxin-associated gene pathogenicity island and vacuolating cytotoxin A, which are major virulence factors in H. pylori. It can be concluded that besides H. pylori, gastric Helicobacter species associated with dogs, cats and pigs are also clinically relevant in humans. Although recent research has provided better insights regarding pathogenic mechanisms and treatment strategies, a lot remains to be investigated, including true prevalence rates, exact modes of transmission and molecular pathways underlying disease development and progression.']",species; suis; dogs; spp; nhph; helicobacter; heilmannii; cats; humans; animals,species · suis · dogs

BACKGROUND This study aims to elucidate the knowledge and practice of general practitioners (GP) and internists regarding diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori ) infection in a high prevalent area, with the intent to assist with future educational strategies for H. pylori infection. METHODS In this cross-sectional study in Guilan, a Northern Province of Iran, all GPs and internists in the city of Rasht were included. Questionnaires consisted of questions on demographic characteristics in addition to physicians' knowledge and practice regarding H. pylori infection. The questionnaire was verified by a panel of experts, validated by the test-retest method, and distributed among participants. Scores higher than the mean score indicated good knowledge or attitude. Those lower than the mean score indicated poor knowledge and attitude. Data were collected and analyzed by SPSS version software. RESULTS The mean (SD) knowledge and practice score of physicians was ± and ±, respectively. Overall, % of GPs and % of internists exhibited good knowledge scores, while % of GPs and % of internists showed good practice. Physicians who used books or educational programs and had working histories of less than years scored significantly higher in terms of mean knowledge. The mean practice score of physicians who worked in public units and had working histories of more than years and those who had used books or educational programs was significantly higher.

The most widely used antibiotic regimen was clarithromycin plus amoxicillin (%), followed by metronidazole plus tetracycline (%). Ninety-two percent of the physicians confirmed eradication through endoscopy for the histologic analysis and only % utilized the breath test.

This study aimed to conduct a national survey on the knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding H pylori infection in Chinese physicians and the public. METHODS: This was an Internet-based survey of the general Chinese population and Chinese physicians from different specialties, carried out from January to February . Both surveys (general population's and physicians') included questions to assess the knowledge and attitudes toward H pylori and its action. RESULTS: A total of people and physicians were enrolled. In the population, the proportion of subjects who answered correctly to all questions about H pylori's infectivity was only %, and that for H pylori's harmfulness and that for H pylori preventive measures were % and %, respectively. In general, physicians had a better understanding of H pylori's harmfulness (%) than the other population. The vast majority of the surveyed population (%) and physicians (%) supported a national H pylori screening plan to prevent gastric cancer. The support ratio paralleled with the overall knowledge level. Unexpectedly, gastroenterologists tend to have a relatively low support rate for H pylori screening than non-gastroenterologists (% vs %, P < .), which may be related to consideration of heavy medical burden (%).

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has been well-established as a significant risk factor for several gastrointestinal disorders. The urea breath test (UBT) has emerged as a leading non-invasive method for detecting H. pylori. Despite numerous studies confirming its substantial accuracy, the reliability of UBT results is often compromised by inherent limitations. These findings underscore the need for a rigorous statistical synthesis to clarify and reconcile the diagnostic accuracy of the UBT for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. AIM: To determine and compare the diagnostic accuracy of 13C-UBT and 14C-UBT for H. pylori infection in adult patients with dyspepsia. METHODS: We conducted an independent search of the PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases until April . Our search included diagnostic accuracy studies that evaluated at least one of the index tests (13C-UBT or 14C-UBT) against a reference standard. We used the QUADAS- tool to assess the methodological quality of the studies. We utilized the bivariate random-effects model to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative test likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), as well as the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and their % confidence intervals. We conducted subgroup analyses based on urea dosing, time after urea administration, and assessment technique. To investigate a possible threshold effect, we conducted Spearman correlation analysis, and we generated summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves to assess heterogeneity. Finally, we visually inspected a funnel plot and used Egger's test to evaluate publication bias. RESULTS: The titles and abstracts of studies were screened; articles were retrieved and selected for full-text reading. Finally, studies were included in the diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis. Our analysis demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy of 13C-UBT over 14C-UBT, indicated by higher sensitivity (% vs %), specificity (% vs %), likelihood ratios (LR+ vs ; LR- vs ), and area under the curve (AUC; vs ). Notably, 13C-UBT's DOR () significantly outperforms 14C-UBT (DOR ), making it the preferred diagnostic tool for dyspeptic individuals with H. pylori infection. Correlation analysis revealed no threshold effect (13C-UBT: r = ; 14C-UBT: r = -), and SROC curves showed consistent accuracy. Both 13C-UBT and 14C-UBT showed high AUC values (13C-UBT ; 14C-UBT ) near , reinforcing their excellent accuracy and endorsing both as reliable diagnostic tools in clinical practice. CONCLUSION: In summary, our study has demonstrated that 13C-UBT has been found to outperform the 14C-UBT, making it the preferred diagnostic approach. Additionally, our results emphasize the significance of carefully considering urea dosage, assessment timing, and measurement techniques for both tests to enhance diagnostic precision. Nevertheless, it is crucial for researchers and clinicians to evaluate the strengths and limitations of our findings before implementing them in practice."", ""A re-testing range is recommended for 13C- and 14C-urea breath tests for Helicobacter pylori infection in China.. BACKGROUND: The urea breath test (UBT) is widely used for diagnosing Helicobacter pylori infection. In the Shenzhen Kuichong People's Hospital, some UBT findings were contradictory to the histology outcomes, therefore this study aimed to assess and compare the diagnostic performance of both 13C- and 14C-UBT assays. METHODS: We recruited H. pylori-treatment naïve patients, among which and were tested by the 13C-UBT or 14C-UBT, respectively. The cutoff value for H. pylori positivity based on manufacturer's instruction was % delta over baseline (DOB) for the 13C-UBT, and disintegrations per minute (DPM) for the 14C-UBT. Gastric biopsies of the antrum and corpus were obtained during endoscopy for histopathology. RESULTS: In patients who were tested using the 13C-UBT kit, histopathology was positive in out of UBT-positive patients (% concordance), and negative in out of UBT-negative cases (% concordance). For the 14C-UBT-tested patients, histopathology was positive for H. pylori in out of UBT-positive patients (% concordance), and negative in out of UBT-negative cases (% concordance). While the 13C-UBT and 14C-UBT each had a high sensitivity level of % and %, respectively, their specificity was low, at % and %, respectively. By using new optimal cutoff values and including an indeterminate range (-% DOB for 13C-UBT and - DPM for 14C-UBT), the specificity values can be improved to % and % for the 13C- and 14C-UBT, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of an indeterminate range is recommended to allow for repeated testing to confirm H. pylori infection, and thereby avoiding unnecessary antibiotic treatment.

Dietary intake information was collected from the participants using a food frequency questionnaire that has been previously reported as reliable and valid. A rapid urease test and a histological evaluation were used to determine the presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Twenty-three vitamin C-contributing foods were selected, representing over % of the cumulative vitamin C contribution. RESULTS: In analyses adjusted for first-degree family history of gastric cancer, education level, job, household income, smoking status, and regular exercise, an inverse association between vitamin C intake and gastric cancer risk was observed for the highest (≥ mg/d) vs the lowest (< mg/d) intake category [OR (%CI): (-)], with a significant trend across the three intake categories (P = ).

INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection status with white light imaging (WLI) is difficult. We evaluated the accuracies of using WLI and linked color imaging (LCI) for diagnosing H. pylori-active gastritis in a multicenter prospective study setting. METHODS: Patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy were prospectively included. The image collection process was randomized and anonymous, and the image set included images with WLI or images with LCI in the corpus that reviewers separately evaluated. Active gastritis was defined as positive when there was diffuse redness in WLI and crimson coloring in LCI. The H. pylori infection status was determined by the urea breath test and the serum antibody test. Cases in which both test results were negative but atrophy or intestinal metaplasia was histologically confirmed were defined as past infections. The primary endpoint was the diagnostic accuracies of WLI and LCI, and the secondary endpoint was inter-observer agreement. RESULTS: Data for patients were analyzed. The endoscopic diagnostic accuracy for active gastritis was (sensitivity of and specificity of ) with WLI and (sensitivity of and specificity of ) with LCI (p = ). LCI significantly improved the accuracy in patients with past infections over WLI ( in WLI and in LCI, p < ). The κ values were in WLI and in LCI.

Nickel is essential for the survival of the pathogenic bacteria Helicobacter pylori in the fluctuating pH of the human stomach. Due to its inherent toxicity and limited availability, nickel homeostasis is maintained through a network of pathways that are coordinated by the nickel-responsive transcription factor NikR. Nickel binding to H. pylori NikR (HpNikR) induces an allosteric response favoring a conformation that can bind specific DNA motifs, thereby serving to either activate or repress transcription of specific genes involved in nickel homeostasis and acid adaptation. Here, we examine how nickel induces this response using 19F-NMR, which reveals conformational and dynamic changes associated with nickel-activated DNA complex formation. HpNikR adopts an equilibrium between an open state and DNA-binding competent states regardless of nickel binding, but a higher level of dynamics is observed in the absence of metal. Nickel binding shifts the equilibrium toward the binding-competent states and decreases the mobility of the DNA-binding domains. The nickel-bound protein is then able to adopt a single conformation upon binding a target DNA promoter. Zinc, which does not promote high-affinity DNA binding, is unable to induce the same allosteric response as nickel. We propose that the allosteric mechanism of nickel-activated DNA binding by HpNikR is driven by conformational selection.', 'Hierarchical regulation of the NikR-mediated nickel response in Helicobacter pylori.. Nickel is an essential metal for Helicobacter pylori, as it is the co-factor of two enzymes crucial for colonization, urease and hydrogenase. Nickel is taken up by specific transporters and its intracellular homeostasis depends on nickel-binding proteins to avoid toxicity. Nickel trafficking is controlled by the Ni(II)-dependent transcriptional regulator NikR. In contrast to other NikR proteins, NikR from H. pylori is a pleiotropic regulator that depending on the target gene acts as an activator or a repressor. We systematically quantified the in vivo Ni(+)-NikR response of direct NikR targets that encode functions related to nickel metabolism, four activated and seven repressed genes. Among these, four targets were characterized for the first time (hpn, hpn-like, hydA and hspA) and NikR binding to their promoter regions was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We found that NikR-dependent repression was generally set up at higher nickel concentrations than activation. Kinetics of the regulation revealed a gradual and temporal NikR-mediated response to nickel where activation of nickel-protection mechanisms takes place before repression of nickel uptake. Our in vivo study demonstrates, for the first time, a chronological hierarchy in the NikR-dependent transcriptional response to nickel that is coherent with the control of nickel homeostasis in H. pylori.', 'The metal- and DNA-binding activities of Helicobacter pylori NikR.. The pathogenic bacteria Helicobacter pylori require nickel as a cofactor of the enzymes urease and hydrogenase. One of the proteins that controls nickel homeostasis in this organism is Helicobacter pylori NikR (HpNikR), a homologue of nickel-dependent transcription factors from other organisms, which regulates the expression of multiple proteins such as the urease structural subunits and itself. To examine the properties of this protein, metal analysis was used to demonstrate that HpNikR can bind stoichiometric nickel or copper, and electronic absorption spectroscopy revealed that HpNikR binds nickel with picomolar affinity in what is likely a conserved square-planar site. In vitro DNA-binding assays revealed that HpNikR can bind directly to the promoter region of the ureA operon in response to nickel, and the location of the binding site was defined. Nickel also induces DNA binding to the nikR promoter sequence but the complex is much weaker. These experiments suggest that HpNikR directly controls the expression of multiple genes by binding to separate DNA sequences, and the possible mechanisms for differential regulation are discussed.']",nickel; metal; urease; binding; nikr; ions; hpnikr; ni; hypa; niii,nickel · metal · urease

Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection is directly associated with over % of all gastric cancer (GC) cases. Currently available HP tests are prone to false negatives and are inapt for decentralization. Reliable and user-friendly detection platforms for timely diagnosis and routine monitoring are critical to patient survival. Herein, we targeted this unmet need by developing a novel biosensing platform that strategically combined the robust versatility of electrochemical techniques with the sensitivity and specificity of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to enable the accurate detection of HP at the point-of-care (POC). The biosensor design consisted of an underlying screen-printed carbon electrode (SCPE), sequentially modified with (i) highly conductive acid-functionalized sp2 graphene (Gr) and (ii) needle-like gold microstructures encapsulated with (iii) pH-sensitive polyaniline (PANI), assembled between laser-cut cover layers with a built-in reaction chamber for facile sample handling and detection.

The proposed biosensor has a linear range of - pM and a detection limit of pM for detection of H. pylori. In addition, the biosensor have responded very well in the simulated real sample evaluations, signifying its potential to be used in future clinical detection of the H. pylori bacteria.']",detection; electrochemical; lamp; dna; sensor; biosensor; amplification; nucleic; for; limit,detection · electrochemical · lamp

BACKGROUND: Endoscopic findings of nodular gastritis (NG) are characterized by the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection and follicular gastritis. A possible association with diffuse-type gastric cancer has recently been suggested from observations in Japanese. Our aim was to analyze antral nodularity and histological scores in young adults. METHODS: Subjects ( men and women; age range, - years) with upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms or positive H. pylori antibodies underwent endoscopy. One specimen each was obtained from the greater and lesser curvatures (curves) of the corpus and from those of the antrum. Endoscopic appearance was assessed using % indigo carmine, and histopathological grading was evaluated by the updated Sydney System. RESULTS: Antral nodularity was identified in none of H. pylori-negative subjects and in of (%) H. pylori-positive subjects. By the distribution of nodular or granular elevated lesions in the antrum, NG was divided into diffuse (n = ) or nondiffuse (n = ) types. The diffuse-type NG predominantly affected women (odds ratio, ; % confidence interval, -). The atrophy scores in the lesser curve of the antrum were significantly higher in the nondiffuse than in the diffuse group. However, the scores for activity, inflammation, and H. pylori density were not significantly different among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse-type NG depended on sex, and antral nodularity seemed to change from the diffuse to the nondiffuse type in association with atrophy.', 'Endoscopic patterns and histopathological features after eradication therapy in Helicobacter pylori-associated nodular gastritis.. The endoscopic finding of nodular gastritis (NG) is highly associated with presence of Helicobacter pylori infection.

Twenty-one adults ( men and women) with H. pylori-associated NG found on endoscopy were enrolled for this study. The histological findings included gastritis activity, bacterial colonization, and lymphoid follicles. Repeat endoscopy for the endoscopic as well as histopathological features of gastric biopsy specimens was performed months later after eradication treatment. H. pylori was successfully eradicated in patients. Endoscopic NG disappeared in , improved in , and was unchanged in . After treatment, there was significant improvement in scores for gastritis activity [P < , % confidence interval (CI) -], bacterial colonization (P < , % CI -) and follicular gastritis (P = , % CI -), primarily among patients whose endoscopic pattern resolved completely.

In Helicobacter pylori, iron balance is controlled by the Ferric uptake regulator (Fur), an iron-sensing repressor protein that typically regulates expression of genes implicated in iron transport and storage. Herein, we carried out extensive analysis of Fur-regulated promoters and identified a -- motif with dyad symmetry ('-TAATAATnATTATTA-'), which functions as the Fur box core sequence of H. pylori. Addition of this sequence to the promoter region of a typically non-Fur regulated gene was sufficient to impose Fur-dependent regulation in vivo. Moreover, mutation of this sequence within Fur-controlled promoters negated regulation. Analysis of the H. pylori chromosome for the occurrence of the Fur box established the existence of well-conserved Fur boxes in the promoters of numerous known Fur-regulated genes, and revealed novel putative Fur targets. Transcriptional analysis of the new candidate genes demonstrated Fur-dependent repression of HPG27_51, HPG27_52, HPG27_199, HPG27_445, HPG27_825 and HPG27_1063, as well as Fur-mediated activation of the cytotoxin associated gene A, cagA (HPG27_507). Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed specific binding of Fur to the promoters of each of these genes. Future experiments will determine whether loss of Fur regulation of any of these particular genes contributes to the defects in colonization exhibited by the H. pylori fur mutant."", 'Helicobacter pylori apo-Fur regulation appears unconserved across species.. The Ferric Uptake Regulator (Fur) is a transcriptional regulator that is conserved across a broad number of bacterial species and has been shown to regulate expression of iron uptake and storage genes. Additionally, Fur has been shown to be an important colonization factor of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. In H. pylori, Fur-dependent regulation appears to be unique in that Fur is able to act as a transcriptional repressor when bound to iron as well as in its iron free (apo) form. To date, apo-regulation has not been identified in any other bacterium. To determine whether Fur from other species has the capacity for apo-regulation, we investigated the ability of Fur from Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio cholerae to complement both iron-bound and apo-Fur regulation within the context of a H. pylori fur mutant. We found that while some Fur species (E. coli, C. jejuni, and V. cholerae) complemented iron-bound regulation, apo-regulation was unable to be complemented by any of the examined species. These data suggest that despite the conservation among bacterial Fur proteins, H. pylori Fur contains unique structure/function features that make it novel in comparison to Fur from other species.', 'Transcriptional profiling of Helicobacter pylori Fur- and iron-regulated gene expression.. Intracellular iron homeostasis is a necessity for almost all living organisms, since both iron restriction and iron overload can result in cell death. The ferric uptake regulator protein, Fur, controls iron homeostasis in most Gram-negative bacteria. In the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, Fur is thought to have acquired extra functions to compensate for the relative paucity of regulatory genes. To identify H. pylori genes regulated by iron and Fur, we used DNA array-based transcriptional profiling with RNA isolated from H. pylori wild-type and fur mutant cells grown in iron-restricted and iron-replete conditions. Sixteen genes encoding proteins involved in metal metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, motility, cell wall synthesis and cofactor synthesis displayed iron-dependent Fur-repressed expression. Conversely, genes encoding proteins involved in iron storage, respiration, energy metabolism, chemotaxis, and oxygen scavenging displayed iron-induced Fur-dependent expression. Several Fur-regulated genes have been previously shown to be essential for acid resistance or gastric colonization in animal models, such as those encoding the hydrogenase and superoxide dismutase enzymes. Overall, there was a partial overlap between the sets of genes regulated by Fur and those previously identified as growth-phase, iron or acid regulated. Regulatory patterns were confirmed for five selected genes using Northern hybridization. In conclusion, H. pylori Fur is a versatile regulator involved in many pathways essential for gastric colonization. These findings further delineate the central role of Fur in regulating the unique capacity of H. pylori to colonize the human stomach.']",fur; iron; protein; mutant; proteins; stress; oxidative; that; regulator; hp0231,fur · iron · protein

Background: Mechanisms underlying the high clinical and histological diversity of celiac disease (CD) remain elusive. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) chronically infects gastric and duodenal mucosa and has been associated with protection against some immune-mediated conditions, but its role (specifically of cagA+ strains) in CD is unclear. Objective: To assess the relationship between gastric Hp infection (cagA+ strains) and duodenal histological damage in patients with CD. Design: Case-control study including patients with active-CD, potential-CD and non-celiac individuals. Clinical presentation, HLA genotype, Hp/cagA gene detection in gastric mucosa, duodenal histology, Foxp3 positive cells and TGF-β expression in duodenal lamina propria were analyzed. Results: We recruited patients, active-CD, potential-CD, and non-CD controls. Hp detection was similar in the three groups (~-%), but cagA+ strains were more common in infected potential-CD than in active-CD (/ vs. /; p = ) and non-CD (/; p = ). Among active-CD patients, Foxp3 positivity was significantly higher in subjects with cagA+ Hp+ compared to cagA- Hp+ (p < ) and Hp- (p < ). In cagA+ Hp+ individuals, Foxp3 positivity was also higher comparing active- to potential-CD (p < ). TGF-β expression in duodenum was similar in active-CD with cagA+ Hp+ compared to Hp- and was significantly downregulated in cagA+ potential-CD subjects compared to other groups. Conclusion: Hp infection rates were similar among individuals with/without CD, but infection with cagA+ strains was associated with milder histological damage in celiac patients infected by Hp, and in active-CD cases with higher expression of T-reg markers. Results suggest that infection by cagA+ Hp may be protective for CD progression, or conversely, that these strains are prone to colonize intestinal mucosa with less severe damage.', 'Celiac disease and Helicobacter pylori infection in children: Is there any Association?. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection can influence the inflammatory and immune responses in the gut and may therefore play a role in the development of gluten-related enteropathy in genetically susceptible individuals.

METHODS: Children (- years) diagnosed as celiac disease (CD) (n = ) with submission of gastric and duodenal biopsies and duodenal histology having Marsh grade III features were eligible for the study. Non-celiac patients referred for endoscopy were selected as controls. We studied proportion of HP prevalence in children with confirmed CD as compared with HP prevalence in reference group comprising non-celiac children referred for endoscopy. We also evaluated predictors of HP infection in children with celiac disease. RESULTS: Of the participants with CD, gastric HP was seen in (%) patients. The prevalence of HP in patients without CD (%, P < ) was significantly higher. Among patients with CD, HP infection was most frequent in patients with Marsh IIIa. In the stepwise regression analysis for risk factors of HP infection in CD patients: presence of gastritis, hemoglobin, and absence of scalloping were found to be independent predictors in a multivariate setup.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer significantly contributes to cancer mortality globally. Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is a stage in the Correa cascade and a premalignant lesion of gastric cancer. The natural history of GIM formation and progression over time is not fully understood. Currently, there are no clear guidelines on GIM surveillance or management in the United States. AIM: To investigate factors associated with GIM development over time in African American-predominant study population. METHODS: This is a retrospective longitudinal study in a single tertiary hospital in Washington DC. We retrieved upper esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs) with gastric biopsies from the pathology department database from January to December . Patients included in the study had undergone two or more EGDs with gastric biopsy. Patients with no GIM at baseline were followed up until they developed GIM or until the last available EGD. Exclusion criteria consisted of patients age < , pregnancy, previous diagnosis of gastric cancer, and missing data including pathology results or endoscopy reports. The study population was divided into two groups based on GIM status. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard induced by patient demographics, EGD findings, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) status on the GIM status. RESULTS: Of patients who had at least EGD with gastric biopsy, patients were included in the study. patients developed GIM during the study follow-up period of d on average, compared to d in patients without GIM (P = ). The average age of GIM group was years compared to years in the non-GIM group (P < ). In the GIM group, adding one year to the age increases the risk for GIM formation by % (P < ).

No gender difference was observed between the study populations. Gastritis was associated with an increased risk for GIM development with an HR of (, ). On the other hand, H. pylori infection did not increase the risk for GIM. CONCLUSION: An increase in age and non-Caucasian race/ethnicity are associated with an increased risk of GIM formation. The effect of H. pylori on GIM is limited in low prevalence areas.', 'Diagnosis and Management of Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia: Current Status and Future Directions.. Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is a known premalignant condition of the human stomach along the pathway to gastric cancer (GC). Histologically, GIM represents the replacement of normal gastric mucosa by mucin-secreting intestinal mucosa. Helicobacter pylori infection is the most common etiologic agent of GIM development worldwide. The prevalence of GIM is heterogeneous among different regions of the world and correlates with the population endemicity of H. pylori carriage, among other environmental factors. GC remains the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally. GIM is usually diagnosed by upper endoscopy with biopsy, and histologic scoring systems have been developed to risk-stratify patients at highest risk for progression to GC. Several recent endoscopic imaging modalities may improve the optical detection of GIM and early GC. Appropriate surveillance of GIM may be cost effective and represents an opportunity for the early diagnosis and therapy of GC. Certain East Asian nations have established population-level programs for the screening and surveillance of GIM; guidelines regarding GIM surveillance have also recently been published in Europe. By contrast, few data exist regarding the appropriateness of surveillance of GIM in the United States. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of GIM with an emphasis on the role of appropriate endoscopic surveillance.', 'Prevalence, risk factors, and surveillance patterns for gastric intestinal metaplasia among patients undergoing upper endoscopy with biopsy..

There exist few data regarding the prevalence of, risk factors for, and clinical practice patterns regarding GIM in the United States. Furthermore, there are currently no U.S. guidelines regarding screening/surveillance for GIM. METHODS: All consecutive upper endoscopic procedures from academic medical centers in Seattle between and were reviewed. Demographic, clinical, and endoscopic covariates were recorded at time of endoscopy. Procedures with gastric biopsy were matched to final the histologic diagnoses, including the presence of Helicobacter pylori. Cases of GIM and dysplasia were recorded and compared with non-GIM controls using univariate and multivariable regression. Surveillance patterns for cases of GIM were recorded. RESULTS: Data from , upper endoscopies, , gastric biopsies, cases of GIM, cases of dysplasia, and cases of GC were captured. The point prevalence of GIM was % in patients who underwent gastric biopsy. Non-white race (P < .), increasing age (P < .), and presence of H pylori (P < .) were associated with GIM. If GIM was present, increasing age (P < .) and male gender (P < .) were associated with progression, and the presence of H pylori (P < .) was inversely associated with progression to dysplasia/GC. Few cases of GIM/dysplasia/GC were identified during procedures for GIM screening/surveillance. Only % of patients with a diagnosis of GIM received a recommendation for surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of GIM among non-white and Hispanic Americans.

Infection with CagA-positive Helicobacter pylori is associated with the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. The CagA gene product CagA is injected directly from the bacterium into the bacterium-attached gastric epithelial cells via the type-IV secretion system. Upon membrane localization and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases, CagA functions as a scaffolding adaptor and interacts with a number of host proteins that regulate cell growth, cell motility and cell polarity in both CagA phosphorylation-dependent and phosphorylation-independent manners. Of special interest is the interaction of CagA with the SHP- tyrosine phosphatase, gain-of-function mutations that of which have recently been found in a variety of human malignancies. The CagA-SHP- interaction is entirely dependent on CagA tyrosine phosphorylation and, through the complex formation, SHP- is catalytically activated and induces morphological transformation with elevated cell motility. Intriguingly, structural diversity of the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of CagA accounts for the differential activity of individual CagA to bind and activate SHP-. Deregulation of SHP- and other intracellular signaling molecules by H. pylori CagA may predispose cells to accumulate multiple genetic and epigenetic changes involved in gastric carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the differential potential of individual CagA to disturb cellular functions indicates that H. pylori strains carrying biologically more active CagA are more virulent than those with less active CagA and are more closely associated with gastric carcinoma.', 'Helicobacter pylori stimulates epithelial cell migration via CagA-mediated perturbation of host cell signaling.. Helicobacter pylori CagA is delivered into gastric epithelial cells, where undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at the Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motif to interact with Src homology -containing protein tyrosine phosphatase- (SHP2) oncoprotein. CagA also binds to partitioning-defective (PAR1) polarity-regulating kinase via the CagA multimerization (CM) sequence. To investigate pathophysiological role of CagA-SHP2 and/or CagA-PAR1 interaction in H. pylori infection, we generated H. pylori isogenic strains producing a phosphorylation-resistant CagA and a CagA without CM sequence. Infection studies revealed that deregulation of epithelial cell motility was more prominent in the wild-type strain than in the mutant strains. Thus, both CagA-SHP2 and CagA-PAR1 interactions are involved in the pathogenicity of cagA-positive H. pylori.', '[H. pylori oncoprotein CagA and gastric cancer].. Helicobacter pylori CagA is the first identified bacterial oncoprotein playing a critical role in gastric carcinogenesis. Upon delivery into gastric epithelial cells via type IV secretion, CagA is localized to the plasma membrane, where it acts as a pathogenic scaffold/hub that promiscuously interacts with a number of host signaling molecules. Especially, CagA binds to the polarity-regulating kinase PAR1/MARK and inhibits the kinase activity. Following tyrosine phosphorylation by host kinases, CagA also acquires the ability to interact with the oncogenic tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and deregulates the phosphatase activity. Through these interactions, CagA deregulates intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and cell movement, while causing epithelial junctional and polarity defects. These CagA activities collectively contribute to the development of gastric carcinoma.']",caga; phosphorylation; tyrosine; epithelial; cells; kinase; cell; shp2; protein; src,caga · phosphorylation · tyrosine

The objective of this study is to compare the performance of enzyme immunoassay (Premier Platinum HpSA) and immunochromatographic method (ImmunoCard HpSA STAT) in detecting stool Helicobacter pylori antigen before and after eradication therapy. Two hundred forty dyspeptic patients ( men and women; mean age, years old; range, - years old) volunteered to participate in this study. Those who delivered improper stool samples, including diarrhea, inadequate amount, or delayed delivery after collection, were excluded. All of the participants received endoscopy, biopsy-based tests, and noninvasive tests, including ()C-urea breath test (()C-UBT) and stool antigen tests. Fifty-eight patients completed all the above tests before and after eradication therapy, and each contributed to person-times.

Similarly stool specimens for PCR and HpSA test were collected during both the periods from all patients. Biopsy, PCR and RUT results together were considered the ""gold standard."" RESULTS: On the basis of gold standard tests, / patients were H. pylori positive. The sensitivity and specificity of HpSA test were % and % respectively in untreated patients. On the other hand, the sensitivity and specificity of stool PCR in untreated patients were % and % respectively. After eradication therapy, the results of both RUT and biopsy PCR were negative in % and positive in % of the patients. Although post treatment sensitivity of HpSA and stool PCR was equal (%), specificity of HpSA and stool PCR were % and % respectively. CONCLUSION: The H. pylori stool tests represent a non-invasive concept for diagnosis of infection.

BACKGROUND: Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of the stool antigen test and the optimal time point for detecting Helicobacter pylori infection in a Mongolian gerbil model. METHODS: We inoculated -week-old Mongolian gerbils with H. pylori (Vac A (+)/CagA(+)). The gerbil-infected model was developed as follows: H. pylori was put into broth (about () CFU/ml), and gerbils were then fed with ml intragastrically twice within a -day interval. Another ten gerbils were fed broth only. Twenty-six weeks after the inoculation, the gerbils were killed.

BACKGROUND: Gastric Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and colorectal polyps are more prevalent in African Americans than in the general population. We aimed to investigate whether gastric H. pylori infection is associated with colorectal polyps in African Americans. METHODS: Medical records of African Americans, years and older (n = ) who underwent bidirectional gastrointestinal endoscopy on the same day were reviewed. H. pylori status was assessed by immunohistochemistry on gastric specimens. Colorectal polyps were confirmed by histological examination of colorectal biopsies. A subset of serum samples from healthy and polyp-bearing patients (n = ) were analyzed by ELISA for anti-H. pylori and anti-CagA antibodies. The crude and adjusted effect of H. pylori on the risk of colorectal adenoma and polyp were computed by logistic regression models.

Therefore, it is essential to identify other independent risk factors. In this study, we explored the link between Hp infection, atrophic gastritis, and colorectal polyps to identify a new potential risk factors of colorectal polyps. METHODS: In this study, atrophic gastritis and intestinal polyps were diagnosed by endoscopy and pathology. All the patients in this retrospective study were divided into sub-groups based on the presence of colorectal polyps. The correlation between polyps and atrophic gastritis was analyzed using the chi-square test and Kruskal-Wallis test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to compare the predictive value for colorectal polyps between Hp infection and atrophic gastritis. Binary logistic regression was utilized to identify independent risk factors for colorectal polyps. RESULTS: Patients with colorectal polyps were primarily male with advanced age, and the number of patients with colorectal polyps had a higher association with smoking, alcohol drinking, and Hp infection than the control group. A positive correlation between the number of colorectal polyps and the severity of atrophic gastritis was observed. ROC analysis showed that atrophic gastritis was a better risk factors for colorectal polyps.

UNLABELLED: Bacterial MutS proteins are subdivided into two families, MutS1 and MutS2. MutS1 family members recognize DNA replication errors during their participation in the well-characterized mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. In contrast to the well-described function of MutS1, the function of MutS2 in bacteria has remained less clear. In Helicobacter pylori and Thermus thermophilus, MutS2 has been shown to suppress homologous recombination. The role of MutS2 is unknown in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis In this work, we investigated the contribution of MutS2 to maintaining genome integrity in B. subtilis We found that deletion of mutS2 renders B. subtilis sensitive to the natural antibiotic mitomycin C (MMC), which requires homologous recombination for repair. We demonstrate that the C-terminal small MutS-related (Smr) domain is necessary but not sufficient for tolerance to MMC. Further, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system to test if the inducible prophage PBSX was the underlying cause of the observed MMC sensitivity. Genetic analysis revealed that MMC sensitivity was dependent on recombination and not on nucleotide excision repair or a symptom of prophage PBSX replication and cell lysis. We found that deletion of mutS2 resulted in decreased transformation efficiency using both plasmid and chromosomal DNA. Further, deletion of mutS2 in a strain lacking the Holliday junction endonuclease gene recU resulted in increased MMC sensitivity and decreased transformation efficiency, suggesting that MutS2 could function redundantly with RecU. Together, our results support a model where B. subtilis MutS2 helps to promote homologous recombination, demonstrating a new function for bacterial MutS2. IMPORTANCE: Cells contain pathways that promote or inhibit recombination. MutS2 homologs are Smr-endonuclease domain-containing proteins that have been shown to function in antirecombination in some bacteria. We present evidence that B. subtilis MutS2 promotes recombination, providing a new function for MutS2. We found that cells lacking mutS2 are sensitive to DNA damage that requires homologous recombination for repair and have reduced transformation efficiency. Further analysis indicates that the C-terminal Smr domain requires the N-terminal portion of MutS2 for function in vivo Moreover, we show that a mutS2 deletion is additive with a recU deletion, suggesting that these proteins have a redundant function in homologous recombination. Together, our study shows that MutS2 proteins have adapted different functions that impact recombination.', 'The complex methylome of the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori.. The genome of Helicobacter pylori is remarkable for its large number of restriction-modification (R-M) systems, and strain-specific diversity in R-M systems has been suggested to limit natural transformation, the major driving force of genetic diversification in H. pylori. We have determined the comprehensive methylomes of two H. pylori strains at single base resolution, using Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT®) sequencing. For strains and J99-R3, and methylated sequence motifs were identified, respectively. For most motifs, almost all sites occurring in the genome were detected as methylated. Twelve novel methylation patterns corresponding to nine recognition sequences were detected (, ; J99-R3, ). Functional inactivation, correction of frameshifts as well as cloning and expression of candidate methyltransferases (MTases) permitted not only the functional characterization of multiple, yet undescribed, MTases, but also revealed novel features of both Type I and Type II R-M systems, including frameshift-mediated changes of sequence specificity and the interaction of one MTase with two alternative specificity subunits resulting in different methylation patterns. The methylomes of these well-characterized H. pylori strains will provide a valuable resource for future studies investigating the role of H. pylori R-M systems in limiting transformation as well as in gene regulation and host interaction.', 'Characterization of Helicobacter pylori factors that control transformation frequency and integration length during inter-strain DNA recombination.. Helicobacter pylori is a genetically diverse bacterial species, owing in part to its natural competence for DNA uptake that facilitates recombination between strains. Inter-strain DNA recombination occurs during human infection and the H. pylori genome is in linkage equilibrium worldwide. Despite this high propensity for DNA exchange, little is known about the factors that limit the extent of recombination during natural transformation. Here, we identify restriction-modification (R-M) systems as a barrier to transformation with homeologous DNA and find that R-M systems and several components of the recombination machinery control integration length. Type II R-M systems, the nuclease nucT and resolvase ruvC reduced integration length whereas the helicase recG increased it. In addition, we characterized a new factor that promotes natural transformation in H. pylori, dprB. Although free recombination has been widely observed in H. pylori, our study suggests that this bacterium uses multiple systems to limit inter-strain recombination.']",dna; recombination; transformation; rm; repair; restriction; systems; methylation; methyltransferase; that,dna · recombination · transformation

Flagellar biogenesis in bacteria is a complex process in which the transcription of dozens of structural and regulatory genes is coordinated with the assembly of the flagellum. Although the overall process of flagellar biogenesis is conserved among bacteria, the mechanisms used to regulate flagellar gene expression vary greatly among different bacterial species. Many bacteria use the alternative sigma factor σ () (also known as RpoN) to transcribe specific sets of flagellar genes. These bacteria include members of the Epsilonproteobacteria (e.g., Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni), Gammaproteobacteria (e.g., Vibrio and Pseudomonas species), and Alphaproteobacteria (e.g., Caulobacter crescentus). This review characterizes the flagellar transcriptional hierarchies in these bacteria and examines what is known about how flagellar gene regulation is linked with other processes including growth phase, quorum sensing, and host colonization.', 'Requirement of the flagellar protein export apparatus component FliO for optimal expression of flagellar genes in Helicobacter pylori.. Flagellar biogenesis in Helicobacter pylori involves the coordinated expression of flagellar genes with assembly of the flagellum. The H. pylori flagellar genes are organized into three regulons based on the sigma factor needed for their transcription (RpoD [σ()], RpoN [σ()], or FliA [σ()]). Transcription of RpoN-dependent genes is activated by a two-component system consisting of the sensor kinase FlgS and the response regulator FlgR. While the cellular cues sensed by the FlgS/FlgR two-component system remain to be elucidated, previous studies revealed that disrupting certain components of the flagellar export apparatus inhibited transcription of the RpoN regulon. FliO is the least conserved of the membrane-bound components of the export apparatus and has not been annotated for any of the H. pylori genomes sequenced to date. A PSI-BLAST analysis identified a potential H. pylori FliO protein which membrane topology algorithms predict to possess a large N-terminal periplasmic domain that is absent from FliO of Escherichia coli and Salmonella, the paradigms for flagellar structure/function studies. FliO was necessary for flagellar biogenesis as well as wild-type levels of motility and transcription of RpoN-dependent and FliA-dependent flagellar genes in H. pylori strain B128. FliO also appears to be required for wild-type levels of the export apparatus protein FlhA in the membrane. Interestingly, the periplasmic and cytoplasmic domains were somewhat dispensable for flagellar gene regulation and assembly, suggesting that these domains have relatively minor roles in flagellar synthesis.', 'Basal Body Structures Differentially Affect Transcription of RpoN- and FliA-Dependent Flagellar Genes in Helicobacter pylori.. UNLABELLED: Flagellar biogenesis in Helicobacter pylori is regulated by a transcriptional hierarchy governed by three sigma factors, RpoD (σ()), RpoN (σ()), and FliA (σ()), that temporally coordinates gene expression with the assembly of the flagellum. Previous studies showed that loss of flagellar protein export apparatus components inhibits transcription of flagellar genes. The FlgS/FlgR two-component system activates transcription of RpoN-dependent genes though an unknown mechanism. To understand better the extent to which flagellar gene regulation is coupled to flagellar assembly, we disrupted flagellar biogenesis at various points and determined how these mutations affected transcription of RpoN-dependent (flaB and flgE) and FliA-dependent (flaA) genes. The MS ring (encoded by fliF) is one of the earliest flagellar structures assembled. Deletion of fliF resulted in the elimination of RpoN-dependent transcripts and an ∼-fold decrease in flaA transcript levels. FliH is a cytoplasmic protein that functions with the C ring protein FliN to shuttle substrates to the export apparatus. Deletions of fliH and genes encoding C ring components (fliM and fliY) decreased transcript levels of flaB and flgE but had little or no effect on transcript levels of flaA. Transcript levels of flaB and flgE were elevated in mutants where genes encoding rod proteins (fliE and flgBC) were deleted, while transcript levels of flaA was reduced ∼-fold in both mutants. We propose that FlgS responds to an assembly checkpoint associated with the export apparatus and that FliH and one or more C ring component assist FlgS in engaging this flagellar structure. IMPORTANCE: The mechanisms used by bacteria to couple transcription of flagellar genes with assembly of the flagellum are poorly understood. The results from this study identified components of the H. pylori flagellar basal body that either positively or negatively affect expression of RpoN-dependent flagellar genes. Some of these basal body proteins may interact directly with regulatory proteins that control transcription of the H. pylori RpoN regulon, a hypothesis that can be tested by examining protein-protein interactions in vitro.']",flagellar; chemotaxis; motility; flagella; that; motor; mutant; proteins; domain; protein,flagellar · chemotaxis · motility

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori is a gut bacterium that is the primary cause of gastric cancer. H. pylori infection has been consistently associated with lack of access to sanitation and clean drinking water.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Drinking water samples were collected from a single faucet in Lima's Lince district days per week from June to May , and pH, temperature, free available chlorine, and conductivity were measured. Quantities of H. pylori in all water samples were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Relationships between the presence/absence and quantity of H. pylori and water characteristics in the - period were examined using regression methods accounting for the time-series design. RESULTS: Forty-nine of (%) of drinking water samples were contaminated with H. pylori. Statistical analyses identified no associations between sampling date and the likelihood of contamination with H. pylori. Statistically significant relationships were found between lower temperatures and a lower likelihood of the presence of H. pylori (P < .), as well as between higher pH and higher quantities of H. pylori (P < .). CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided evidence of the presence of H. pylori DNA in the drinking water of a single drinking water faucet in the Lince district of Lima. However, no seasonal trends were observed. Further studies are needed to determine the presence of H. pylori in other drinking water sources in other districts in Lima, as well as to determine the viability of H. pylori in these water sources.

Two out of tap water samples (%), out of dental units' water (%) samples, and out of (%) from water cooler in public places were found to be contaminated with H. pylori. H. pylori ureC gene was detected in (%) of water samples including tap water (%), dental units' water (%), refrigerated water with filtration, and (%) water cooler in public places samples. This may be due to the coccoid form of bacteria which is detected by PCR method."", 'Detection of Helicobacter pylori in drinking water treatment plants in Bogotá, Colombia, using cultural and molecular techniques.. Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common causes of chronic bacterial infection in humans, and a predisposing factor for peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. The infection has been consistently associated with lack of access to clean water and proper sanitation. H. pylori has been detected in surface water, wastewater and drinking water. However, its ability to survive in an infectious state in the environment is hindered because it rapidly loses its cultivability. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of cultivable and therefore viable H. pylori in influent and effluent water from drinking water treatment plants (DWTP). A total of influent and effluent water samples were collected from three drinking water treatment plants located at Bogotá city, Colombia. Specific detection of H. pylori was achieved by culture, qPCR and FISH techniques. Fifty-six positive H. pylori cultures were obtained from the water samples. Characteristic colonies were covered by the growth of a large number of other bacteria present in the water samples, making isolation difficult to perform. Thus, the mixed cultures were submitted to Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH) and qPCR analysis, followed by sequencing of the amplicons for confirmation. By qPCR, water samples, both from the influent and the effluent, were positive for the presence of H. pylori. The results of our study demonstrate that viable H. pylori cells were present in both, influent and effluent water samples obtained from drinking water treatment plants in Bogotá and provide further evidence that contaminated water may act as a transmission vehicle for H. pylori. Moreover, FISH and qPCR methods result rapid and specific techniques to identify H. pylori from complex environmental samples such as influent water.']",water; samples; drinking; transmission; wastewater; viable; river; bacteria; of; the,water · samples · drinking

BACKGROUND: Urticaria is a common skin disease characterized by episodes of wheals, and it has a negative effect on patients' quality of life. Large-scale population-based epidemiological studies of urticaria are scarce in China. The aim of this survey was to determine the prevalence, clinical forms, and risk factors of urticaria in the Chinese population. METHODS: This survey was conducted in cities from provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities of China. Two to three communities in each city were selected in this investigation. Participants completed questionnaires and received dermatological examinations. We analyzed the prevalence, clinical forms, and risk factors of urticaria. RESULTS: In total, , questionnaires were distributed and , valid questionnaires were collected (, male and , female participants). The lifetime prevalence of urticaria was %, with % in female and % in male individuals ( P < ). The point prevalence of urticaria was %, with % in female and % in male individuals ( P < ). Concomitant angioedema was found in % of patients. Adults had a higher prevalence of urticaria than adolescents and children. Living in urban areas, exposure to pollutants, an anxious or depressed psychological status, a personal and family history of allergy, thyroid diseases, and Helicobacter pylori infection were associated with a higher prevalence of urticaria. Smoking was correlated with a reduced risk of urticaria. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the lifetime prevalence of urticaria was % and the point prevalence was % in the Chinese population; women had a higher prevalence of urticaria than men. Various factors were correlated with urticaria."", 'Helicobacter pylori associated with chronic urticaria.. Chronic urticaria is one of the most frequent skin diseases in medical practice. Urticaria is defined as acute if the whealing persists for less than six weeks and as chronic if it persists for longer. Chronic urticaria that lasts for several years to decades significantly impairs the quality of life. There is evidence that Helicobacter pylori has a critical role in different extragastric diseases such as chronic urticaria. We present a case of chronic urticaria in an adult patient with H. pylori infection and disease regression after triple anti-H. pylori therapy. In contrast to the autoimmune mechanisms involved in chronic urticaria against which no specific treatment strategy has been developed, infections with H. pylori could be treated with triple therapy. It is suggested that laboratory tests for the detection of this pathogen should be performed in patients with chronic urticaria.', 'Urticaria and infections.. Urticaria is a group of diseases that share a distinct skin reaction pattern. Triggering of urticaria by infections has been discussed for many years but the exact role and pathogenesis of mast cell activation by infectious processes is unclear. In spontaneous acute urticaria there is no doubt for a causal relationship to infections and all chronic urticaria must have started as acute. Whereas in physical or distinct urticaria subtypes the evidence for infections is sparse, remission of annoying spontaneous chronic urticaria has been reported after successful treatment of persistent infections. Current summarizing available studies that evaluated the course of the chronic urticaria after proven Helicobacter eradication demonstrate a statistically significant benefit compared to untreated patients or Helicobacter-negative controls without urticaria (p < ). Since infections can be easily treated some diagnostic procedures should be included in the routine work-up, especially the search for Helicobacter pylori.

Although two studies have indicated a possible link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, these were reported from Europe, where the prevalence of H. pylori infection is not very high. In this study, the prevalence of H. pylori infection was examined in AD patients in Japan, where there is a high prevalence of H. pylori. Consecutive patients referred to the Memory and Dementia Outpatient Clinic from August to March were studied. H. pylori infection status was determined by measuring urinary levels of anti-H. pylori antibody (RAPIRUN(®)). Multiple stepwise logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations of AD with the main predictor variables. Of the patients who visited the clinic, were diagnosed as having AD.

There was no difference in the prevalence of H. pylori infection between patients with AD and controls (% vs. %, p = , crude odds ratio (OR), ). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that older age and male sex, but not H. pylori status, were significantly associated with AD (p < , p = , p = , respectively).

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with Aß peptide and Tau protein deposits, but the initial process inducing the disease and ultimately neurodegeneration has not yet been elucidated. An infectious hypothesis is suggested by the alteration of the blood-brain barrier and the activation of neuroinflammation in the brain, which could play a role, especially in the decrease of Aß peptide clearance. Several viral or bacterial agents have been incriminated, including Helicobacter pylori. Infection by H. pylori is acquired during childhood and often lifetime persisting, inducing a chronic gastric inflammation, which remains asymptomatic in approximately % of cases. However H. pylori infection can induce systemic inflammation and increase homocysteine levels, contributing to worsen AD lesions. Association between H. pylori and AD is suggested by ) epidemiologic studies, which show higher AD prevalence and more pronounced cognitive impairment in infected than in non-infected subjects; ) experimental studies in murine models: a) in a first study we evaluated the impact of H. pylori infection on the brain of non-AD predisposed C57BL/6J mice. After an -month infection, H. pylori induced a significant gastric inflammation but no brain Aβ deposit nor increased neuroinflammation was observed in their brain; b) we currently study the impact of Helicobacter species infection on behavior and cerebral lesions of AD transgenic (APPswe/PS1dE9) mice and their wild type littermate. The results of these studies do not allow to conclude a significant association between AD and H. pylory infection but may contribute to a better understanding of the role of brain neuroinflammation in AD."", ""Implications of Microorganisms in Alzheimer's Disease.. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a deadly brain degenerative disorder that leads to brain shrinkage and dementia. AD is manifested with hyperphosphorylated tau protein levels and amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide buildup in the hippocampus and cortex regions of the brain. The nervous tissue of AD patients also contains fungal proteins and DNA which are linked to bacterial infections, suggesting that polymicrobial infections also occur in the brains of those with AD. Both immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques were employed to assess fungal and bacterial infections in the brain tissue of AD patients and non-AD controls, with the most prevalent fungus genera detected in AD patients being Alternaria, Botrytis, Candida, and Malassezia. Interestingly, Fusarium was the most common genus detected in the control group. Both AD patients and controls were also detectable for Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroides for bacterial infection. At the family level, Burkholderiaceae and Staphylococcaceae exhibited higher levels in the brains of those with AD than the brains of the control group. Accordingly, there is thought to be a viscous cycle of uncontrolled neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the brain, caused by agents such as the herpes simplex virus type (HSV1), Chlamydophilapneumonia, and Spirochetes, and the presence of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), which is associated with an increased proinflammatory response in the immune system. Systemic proinflammatory cytokines are produced by microorganisms such as Cytomegalovirus, Helicobacter pylori, and those related to periodontal infections. These can then cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and lead to the onset of dementia. Here, we reviewed the relationship between the etiology of AD and microorganisms (such as bacterial pathogens, Herpesviridae viruses, and periodontal pathogens) according to the evidence available to understand the pathogenesis of AD. These findings might guide a targeted anti-inflammatory therapeutic approach to AD.""]",ad; dementia; alzheimers; cognitive; brain; neurodegenerative; disease; neurodegeneration; and; between,dementia · alzheimers · cognitive

Background: Helicobacter pylori (HP) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) coinfection lead to chronic inflammation and contribute to the development of gastric cancer. However, studies examining the association between HP virulence factors and EBV infection in gastric cancer are limited. This study investigated the polymorphisms of HP virulence factors associated with EBV infection and their effects on clinical outcomes in EBV-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC). Methods: A total of HP isolates from patients with gastric cancer were divided and analyzed based on EBV coinfection status. Polymerase chain reaction amplifications of virulence factors were conducted using DNA extracts from HP isolates cultured from gastric mucosal specimens. Results: EBV infection was significantly associated with gastric carcinoma with lymphoid stroma morphology and a proximal location in the stomach. Most HP strains from patients with gastric cancer were positive for cagA (%), vacA (%), and iceA1 (%). Among HP isolates with EBV coinfection, the prevalence of iceA2 (% vs. %, p < ) and ureA (% vs. %, p = ) was significantly more frequent, and that of iceA1 (% vs. %, p = ) and vacA s1a (% vs. %, p = ) was less frequent than those of EBV- colonies. Multivariate analysis indicated that ureA (odds ratio, ; % confidence interval [CI], to ; p = ) was associated with EBVaGC. No significant difference in clinical outcomes was observed based on the presence of ureA expression in EBVaGC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of patients with gastric cancer were interviewed, clinicopathological information was retrieved, and in situ hybridization was performed for EBV-encoded small RNAs. RESULTS: There were EBV-GC (male:female=:) and non-EBV-GC patients (male:female=:). A history of previous gastric ulcer was associated with EBV-GC, whereas frequent and heavy alcohol drinking was related to non-EBV-GC. Additionally, skipping breakfast was correlated with EBV-GC in male patients. Other factors, such as body mass index, history of gastritis, Helicobacter pylori infection, ABO blood type, family history of gastric cancer, education level, marital status, occupation, family status, and dietary factors, showed no significant differences between EBV-GC and non-EBV-GC.

The aim of this study is to establish the prevalence of latent EBV infection in patients with chronic gastritis without H. pylori infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, patients with gastritis without H. pylori infection were included. Furthermore, patients with H. pylori gastritis were included in the study as a control group. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (EBV-encoded RNA) and immunohistochemistry (LMP- antibody) were performed in all cases. The prevalence of EBV and its relationship with age, sex, the affected part of the stomach, the density of inflammation, inflammatory activity, intestinal metaplasia, and atrophy were analyzed. RESULTS: In this study, cases showed positive immunostaining for EBV. EBV positivity was seen mostly in the lymphoid tissue ( cases), but it was also detected at the gastric epithelium ( cases). The mean age of the patients was years, which was slightly younger than that of the EBV-negative cases ( years). The inflammation density was higher in EBV-positive cases than the EBV-negative gastritis cases (p=). Intestinal metaplasia was detected in % of the cases. EBV-positive cases had a higher incidence of atrophy without intestinal metaplasia (% vs % without EBV). CONCLUSION: EBV was detected in % of the cases with gastritis without H. pylori infection.

Within the transplant group, no association was found between immunoglobulin G positivity and different variables including upper GIT symptoms, sex, education level, smoking, and dialysis history. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of H pylori was lower in transplant subjects than that of general population. Upper GIT symptoms were equally found in both groups. Hence, the routine eradication of H pylori might not be indicated.', 'Comparison of endoscopic and pathological findings of the upper gastrointestinal tract in transplant candidate patients undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis treatment: a review of literature.. BACKGROUND: Dyspepsia is a common disorder in kidney transplant recipients, and the risk of post-transplant complications is increased in candidates with upper gastrointestinal disease. We evaluated gastrointestinal lesions of kidney transplant candidates on dialysis. METHODS: In this study, endoscopic and pathological findings in hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with gastrointestinal symptoms on the waiting list were compared. RESULTS: The most common non-ulcerous lesions in the endoscopic examination were gastritis (%), erosive gastritis (%), duodenal erosion or duodenitis (%) and esophagitis (%). The ulcerous lesion was present in only patients. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, ulcerated lesion and non-ulcerated lesion rates were similar in both dialysis groups. Histopathological examination revealed Helicobacter pylori (HP) positivity in % of patients. HP positivity rate was significantly higher in PD patients than in HD patients (% vs. %, p = ). Chronic gastritis (%) was the most common pathological finding. HP positivity rate was % in patients with chronic gastritis, but HP was negative in patients without chronic gastritis. In multivariate analysis, male gender, urea and albumin levels were associated with the presence of pathological chronic gastritis. The presence of gastritis, total cholesterol and ferritin levels were found significant for HP positivity. A total cholesterol > mg/dL was significantly related to an increased risk of the presence of HP positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal lesions and HP infection are common in dialysis patients. Dialysis modality may affect the frequency of some lesions. It may be useful to have an endoscopic examination before entering the transplant waiting list for all candidates.', 'Gastrointestinal complications in renal transplant recipients detected by endoscopic biopsies in a developing country.. BACKGROUND: Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the frequency of pathological lesions in GI endoscopic biopsies in recipients of live related renal transplantation in our setting. METHODS: This retrospective survey was carried out at Histopathology Department of Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation, Karachi, from December to January . All consecutive renal transplant patients of all ages and both genders on regular follow up, presenting with GI complaints and in whom GI endoscopic biopsies were performed, were included.

Probiotics are live microbial organisms that are present in foods or dietary supplements and that confer health benefits to the host when ingested in sufficient quantities. Probiotics can be bacterial (e.g. Bifidobacteria spp. and Lactobacillus spp.) or yeasts (e.g. Saccharomyces boulardii). The administration of probiotics is often believed to be by and large beneficial for individuals with inflammatory or infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. These positive effects are generally attributed to the ability of probiotics to regulate intestinal permeability, normalize host intestinal flora, improve gut immune barrier function, and equilibrate the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Of note, however, these claims are not always substantiated by findings from properly conducted clinical trials. Of particular importance, even when results from randomized controlled trials support the beneficial effects of a particular probiotic for a specific indication, the benefits achieved by the probiotic are generally not translatable to other probiotic formulations. This review discusses the gastrointestinal indications for probiotic use and describes the level of evidence that supports the use of specific probiotics for these indications. Several indications are addressed, including enteric infections, gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, necrotizing enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and irritable bowel syndrome.', 'Intestinal colonisation, microbiota and future probiotics?. The human intestine is colonized by a large number of microorganisms, collectively termed microbiota, which support a variety of physiological functions. As the major part of the microbiota has not yet been cultured, molecular methods are required to determine microbial composition and the impact of specific dietary components including probiotics. Probiotics are viable microbial food supplements, which have a beneficial impact on human health. Health-promoting properties have been demonstrated for specific probiotic products. The most significant demonstrations for probiotic efficacy include prevention and treatment of antibiotic associated diarrhea, rotavirus diarrhea and allergy prevention. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (=ATCC ) and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 are the among the best-characterized and most studied probiotic strains with demonstrated impact on human health. New complex targets for probiotics include irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori infection. For future probiotics the most important target is a demonstrated clinical benefit supported by knowledge on the mechanistic actions in the microbiota of the target population. Molecular and genomics-based knowledge of the composition and functions of the microbiota, as well as deviations from the balanced microbiota, will advance the selection of new and specific probiotics. Potential combinations of specific probiotics may prove to be the next step to reduce the risk on intestinal diseases and reconstruct specific microbial deviations.', 'Probiotics as functional foods.. Probiotic products have been widely used in Japan and Europe for years. Probiotics are now emerging as an important category of food supplement in the United States. Questions about the biologic nature, available products, claimed health benefits, and safety and regulation of probiotics are important for both consumers and nutrition professionals. Probiotics can be considered functional foods because they provide health benefits beyond the traditional nutrition function. With few exceptions, most probiotic products currently available contain lactic-acid-producing bacteria, which mainly belong to the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. We reviewed the scientific papers published in major nutrition journals and abstracts available on the PubMed website regarding probiotics. Evidence suggests the following beneficial effects of probiotics: normalization of the intestinal microflora, ability to block the invasion of potential pathogens in the gut, prophylactic or therapeutic treatment for several types of diarrhea, relief of symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, amelioration of lactose intolerance, prevention of colon cancer, modulation of immune function, inhibition of Helicobacter pylori, and possible enhancement of calcium absorption and reduction of blood cholesterol levels. Mechanisms for the above benefits have been proposed, but none has been proven. An adequate level of viable bacteria in a probiotic product and an appropriate daily dose are critical to achieve a health benefit. Because probiotics are not known to be pathogenic and their upper tolerable level is high, they could be promoted as a beneficial food supplement. Currently, no disease-prevention or therapeutic claim for probiotics is legally allowed.']",probiotics; probiotic; diarrhea; boulardii; bowel; effects; microbiota; gastrointestinal; gut; prevention,probiotics · probiotic · diarrhea

The loss of effectiveness of current antibiotics caused by the development of drug resistance has become a severe threat to public health. Current widely used antibiotics are surprisingly targeted at a few bacterial functions - cell wall, DNA, RNA, and protein biosynthesis - and resistance to them is widespread and well identified. There is therefore great interest in the discovery of novel drugs and therapies to tackle antimicrobial resistance, in particular drugs that target other essential processes for bacterial survival. In the past few years a great deal of effort has been focused on the discovery of new inhibitors of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, also known as the shikimic acid pathway, in which chorismic acid is synthesized. The latter compound is the synthetic precursor of L-Phe, L-Tyr, L-Phe, and other important aromatic metabolites. These enzymes are recognized as attractive targets for the development of new antibacterial agents because they are essential in important pathogenic bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori, but do not have any counterpart in human cells. This review is focused on two key enzymes of this pathway, shikimate kinase and type II dehydroquinase. An overview of the use of structure-based design and computational studies for the discovery of selective inhibitors of these enzymes will be provided. A detailed view of the structural changes caused by these inhibitors in the catalytic arrangement of these enzymes, which are responsible for the inhibition of their activity, is described.', ""New Antibiotic Candidates against Helicobacter pylori.. Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the gut of over % of the world's population. It is responsible for most peptic ulcers and is an important risk factor for gastric cancer. Antibiotic treatment for H. pylori infections is challenging as drug resistance has developed to antibiotics with traditional mechanisms of action. H. pylori uses an unusual pathway for menaquinone biosynthesis with '-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (MTAN) catalyzing an essential step. We validated MTAN as a target with a transition-state analogue of the enzyme [Wang, S.; Haapalainen, A. M.; Yan, F.; et al. Biochemistry , , -]. MTAN inhibitors will only be useful drug candidates if they can both include tight binding to the MTAN target and have the ability to penetrate the complex cell membrane found in Gram-negative H. pylori. Here we explore structural scaffolds for MTAN inhibition and for growth inhibition of cultured H. pylori. Sixteen analogues reported here are transition-state analogues of H. pylori MTAN with dissociation constants of pM or below. Ten of these prevent growth of the H. pylori with IC90 values below μg/mL. These remarkable compounds meet the criteria for potent inhibition and cell penetration. As a consequence, new H. pylori antibiotic candidates are identified, all of which prevent H. pylori growth at concentrations --fold lower than the five antibiotics, amoxicillin, metronidazole, levofloxacin, tetracyclin, and clarithromycin, commonly used to treat H. pylori infections. X-ray crystal structures of MTAN cocrystallized with several inhibitors show them to bind in the active site making interactions consistent with transition-state analogues."", ""Identification of immucillin analogue natural compounds to inhibit Helicobacter pylori MTAN through high throughput virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation.. ABSTRACT: One in every two humans is having Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in stomach causing gastric ulcer. Emergence of several drugs in eliminating H. pylori has paved way for emergence of multidrug resistance in them. This resistance is thriving and thereby necessitating the need of a potent drug. Identifying a potential target for medication is crucial. Bacterial '-methylthioadenosine/S-enosyl homocysteine nucleosidase (MTAN) is a multifunctional enzyme that controls seven essential metabolic pathways. It functions as a catalyst in the hydrolysis of the N-ribosidic bond of adenosine-based metabolites: S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), '-methylthioadenosine (MTA), '-deoxyadenosine ('-DOA), and -amino--deoxyfutalosine. H. pylori unlike other bacteria and humans utilises an alternative pathway for menaquinone synthesis. It utilises Futosiline pathway for menaquinone synthesis which are obligatory component in electron transport pathway. Therefore, the enzymes functioning in this pathway represent them-self as a point of attack for new medications. We targeted MTAN protein of H. pylori to find out a potent natural hit to inhibit its growth. A comparative analysis was made with potent H. pylori MTAN (HpMTAN) known inhibitor, '-butylthio-DADMe-Immucillin-A (BuT-DADMe-ImmA) and ZINC natural subset database. Optimized ligands from the ZINC natural database were virtually screened using ligand based pharmacophore hypothesis to obtain the most efficient and potent inhibitors for HpMTAN. The screened leads were evaluated for their therapeutic likeness. Furthermore, the ligands that passed the test were subjected for MM-GBSA with MTAN to reveal the essential features that contributes selectivity. The results showed that Van der Waals contributions play a central role in determining the selectivity of MTAN. Molecular dynamics (MD) studies were carried out for ns to assess the stability of ligands in the active site. MD analysis showed that binding of ZINC00490333 with MTAN is stable compared to reference inhibitor molecule BuT-DADMe-ImmA. Among the natural inhibitors screened after various docking procedures ZINC00490333 has highest binding score for HpMTAN (- ). The ZINC inhibitor was successful in reproducing the BuT-DADMe-ImmA interactions with HpMTAN. Hence we suggest that ZINC00490333 compound may represent as a good lead in designing novel potent inhibitors of HpMTAN. This in silico approach indicates the potential of this molecule for advancing a further step in gastric ulcer treatment.

Levothyroxine (LT4) is a safe, effective means of hormone replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Here, we review the pharmaceutical, pathophysiological and behavioural factors influencing the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of LT4. Any factor that alters the state of the epithelium in the stomach or small intestine will reduce and/or slow absorption of LT4; these include ulcerative colitis, coeliac disease, bariatric surgery, Helicobacter pylori infection, food intolerance, gastritis, mineral supplements, dietary fibre, resins, and various drugs. Once in the circulation, LT4 is almost fully bound to plasma proteins. Although free T4 (FT4) and liothyronine concentrations are extensively buffered, it is possible that drug- or disorder-induced changes in plasma proteins levels can modify free hormone levels. The data on the clinical significance of genetic variants in deiodinase genes are contradictory, and wide-scale genotyping of hypothyroid patients is not currently justified. We developed a decision tree for the physician faced with an abnormally high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level in a patient reporting adequate compliance with the recommended LT4 dose. The physician should review medications, the medical history and the serum FT4 level and check for acute adrenal insufficiency, heterophilic anti-TSH antibodies, antibodies against gastric and intestinal components (gastric parietal cells, endomysium, and tissue transglutaminase ), and Helicobacter pylori infection. The next step is an LT4 pharmacodynamic absorption test; poor LT4 absorption should prompt a consultation with a gastroenterologist and (depending on the findings) an increase in the LT4 dose level. An in-depth etiological investigation can reveal visceral disorders and, especially, digestive tract disorders.', 'Association of Helicobacter pylori infection with osteoporosis risk in a physical examination population.. UNLABELLED: The association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and osteoporosis risk remains equivocal. Our findings showed that H. pylori infection appears to have no effect on the risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Weight status may modify the association of H. pylori infection with low bone mass. PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between baseline H. pylori infection and osteoporosis risk in the general population. METHODS: From January , , to March , , women and men aged over years underwent a health examination. H. pylori infection was detected by the 13C urea breath test. Subjects were classified as having normal bone mineral density (BMD), osteopenia, and osteoporosis according to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Chi-square tests and multinomial logistic regression models were performed to analyze the associations of H. pylori infection with osteopenia and osteoporosis. RESULTS: Of the participants, (%) were H. pylori-positive. The prevalence rates of osteoporosis and osteopenia were % and %, respectively. No differences were observed in the rates of osteoporosis and osteopenia between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative groups (P > ). The association for the trend between the H. pylori infection and osteoporosis was only seen in the nonoverweight subgroup (trend χ2 = , P = ). The odds ratio (OR) between H. pylori infection and osteoporosis was (% CI, -, P = ) after adjusting for sex, age, and body weight status. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that H. pylori infection is not an independent risk factor for osteopenia and osteoporosis. This study did not support the association of H. pylori infection with osteoporosis.', 'Levothyroxine liquid oral substitution as an alternative treatment for refractory hypothyroidism due to gastrointestinal malabsorption: A case report.. Tablets of levothyroxine (LT4) are the most used form for the treatment of hypothyroidism. Some patients may present with refractory hypothyroidism despite a high daily LT4 dose. We report the case of a -year-old woman who was admitted to our department for refractory hypothyroidism. She was treated with μg oral LT4 tablets daily ( μg/kg/day). Despite good compliance and regular intake of high doses of LT4, she had persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of mIU/L. LT4 absorption test was consistent with the diagnosis of malabsorption. Etiological investigations revealed Helicobacter pylori gastritis. Helicobacter infection was adequately treated, but symptoms of hypothyroidism and elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone persisted. Increased LT4 doses ( μg) failed to normalize thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Thus, she was put on LT4 liquid form at a dose of drops/day per day ( µg). Two weeks later, she presented with clinical and biological improvement with a normal free thyroxine level of ng/dL.

Colonization of the human stomach with Helicobacter pylori strains containing the cag pathogenicity island is a risk factor for development of gastric cancer. The cag pathogenicity island contains genes encoding a secreted effector protein (CagA) and components of a type IV secretion system (Cag T4SS). The molecular architecture of the H. pylori Cag T4SS is substantially more complex than that of prototype T4SSs in other bacterial species. In this review, we discuss recent discoveries pertaining to the structure and function of the Cag T4SS and its role in gastric cancer pathogenesis.', 'Helicobacter pylori exploits a unique repertoire of type IV secretion system components for pilus assembly at the bacteria-host cell interface.. Colonization of the human stomach by Helicobacter pylori is an important risk factor for development of gastric cancer. The H. pylori cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI) encodes components of a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that translocates the bacterial oncoprotein CagA into gastric epithelial cells, and CagL is a specialized component of the cag T4SS that binds the host receptor α5β1 integrin. Here, we utilized a mass spectrometry-based approach to reveal co-purification of CagL, CagI (another integrin-binding protein), and CagH (a protein with weak sequence similarity to CagL). These three proteins are encoded by contiguous genes in the cag PAI, and are detectable on the bacterial surface. All three proteins are required for CagA translocation into host cells and H. pylori-induced IL- secretion by gastric epithelial cells; however, these proteins are not homologous to components of T4SSs in other bacterial species. Scanning electron microscopy analysis reveals that these proteins are involved in the formation of pili at the interface between H. pylori and gastric epithelial cells. ΔcagI and ΔcagL mutant strains fail to form pili, whereas a ΔcagH mutant strain exhibits a hyperpiliated phenotype and produces pili that are elongated and thickened compared to those of the wild-type strain. This suggests that pilus dimensions are regulated by CagH. A conserved C-terminal hexapeptide motif is present in CagH, CagI, and CagL. Deletion of these motifs results in abrogation of CagA translocation and IL- induction, and the C-terminal motifs of CagI and CagL are required for formation of pili. In summary, these results indicate that CagH, CagI, and CagL are components of a T4SS subassembly involved in pilus biogenesis, and highlight the important role played by unique constituents of the H. pylori cag T4SS.', 'The Helicobacter pylori Type IV Secretion System Encoded by the cag Pathogenicity Island: Architecture, Function, and Signaling.. Various gram-negative pathogens express type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) which translocate bacterial virulence factors into host target cells to hijack cellular processes for their own benefit and causing disease. The pathology of Helicobacter pylori, the causative agent of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer in humans, strongly depends on a T4SS encoded by the cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI). This T4SS represents a pilus-like structure and a membrane-spanning complex. T4SS assembly is achieved by various protein-protein interactions and several pilus-associated components (CagL, CagI, CagY, and CagA) that allow docking to the host cell integrin member α5β1 followed by delivery of its major effector protein, CagA, across the host cell membrane. In addition, recent studies have shown that H. pylori exploits human CEACAM receptors via the adhesin HopQ, encoded outside of the cagPAI, for bacterial adherence and translocation of CagA. Here, we review the composition and assembly of the H. pylori T4SS and its fundamental role in the infection process. We discuss major CagA-dependent and CagA-independent signaling events by the T4SS in vitro and in animal models in vivo, which include the induction of cytoskeletal rearrangements, membrane dynamics, disturbance of cell polarity as well as transcriptional responses involved in inflammation, cell proliferation, and anti-apoptosis. The contribution of these signaling cascades to H. pylori colonization, and pathogenesis is reviewed.']",cag; t4ss; secretion; iv; cagl; caga; type; host; system; translocation,cag · t4ss · secretion

We utilized the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to establish the presence of bacterial DNA, including from Helicobacter species, in gallstones, bile juice, and gallbladder mucosa from patients with gallstones. METHODS: At cholecystectomy, gallstones, bile samples, and gallbladder mucosa specimens were obtained and subjected to nested PCR using specific 16S rRNA primers of H. pylori and other bacteria. Bacterial species were identified by DNA sequencing analysis. Bacterial 16S rRNA was detected in out of mixed-cholesterol gallstones, out of pure-cholesterol gallstones, and out of pigmented stones. Furthermore, 16S rDNA sequencing identified Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter, Klebsiella, and Helicobacter species. RESULTS: Helicobacter DNA was detected in out of gallstones, out of bile samples, and out of gallbladder specimens. Direct sequencing of Helicobacter amplicons confirmed strains of H. pylori in all four gallstones, five out of six bile samples, and three out of five gallbladder specimens. Almost all mixed-cholesterol gallstones appear to harbor bacterial DNA, predominantly E. coli.

The aim of this work was to investigate the association of chronic infection with C pneumoniae, H pylori and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections and CAD. Fifty patients [ with acute coronary artery disease (ACAD) and with chronic coronary artery disease (CCAD)] in addition to healthy individuals as a control group were involved in this study. The studied individuals were subjected to complete history taking, thorough physical examination, electrocardiography, echocardiography and coronary angiography (for patients). Assessment of blood glucose level, lipid profile and creatine kinase (CK) was performed. Determination of hsCRP was done by nephlemetry, while C pneumoniae-, H pylori- and CMV-specific IgG antibodies was done by enzyme immunoassay. Results showed that the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-c and hsCRP were significantly higher, while HDL-c was significantly lower among patients compared to that of the controls.

Higher percentage of patients had CMV-specific IgG antibody, however, there was no significant difference between the groups. The levels of C pneumoniae and H pylori-specific IgG antibodies were significantly (P<) higher among patients with CAD when compared to that of the controls. CMV-specific IgG level in patients was higher compared to that of the controls, however, the difference was not statistically significant. Among acute CAD patients, C pneumoniae-specific IgG was positively correlated with hsCRP (P<), cholesterol (p<) and HDL-c (P<), while H pylori-specific IgG was positively correlated with triglyceride level (P<). Among patients with CCAD, hsCRP was negatively correlated with HDL-c (P<). There was no significant correlation between the levels of CMV-specific IgG and lipid profile or hsCRP. In conclusion, the level of C pneumoniae and H pylori-specific IgG antibodies are elevated among CAD patients and their presence was associated with development of the disease. They were significantly correlated to cholesterol level. Moreover, C pneumoniae-specific IgG was significantly correlated with hsCRP among ACAD patients, suggesting an important role of these organisms in the development of CAD by altering lipid profile and induction of inflammation.', ""Prevalence of Chlamydophila pneumoniae is higher in aorta and coronary artery than in carotid artery of coronary artery disease patients..

However, there is no single study in which multiple infectious agents have been detected together in different vascular locations in the same population. This would help in determining if there is any leading pathogen in atheromatous plaques of CAD patients.

We performed multiplex RT-PCR for detecting pathogens, viz. C. pneumoniae, H. pylori, CMV and HSV- in different vascular locations of CAD patients. Percent positivity scores for C. pneumoniae, H. pylori, CMV and HSV- in different vascular locations were as follows: aorta (, , and respectively); carotid (, , and respectively); coronary artery (, , and respectively). Combined positivity for C. pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae IgA and RT-PCR for C. pneumoniae) was the highest compared with all other groups.

Therefore, to confirm whether H. pylori eradication treatment is feasible for NAFLD patients in our hospital, we aimed to establish the association between H. pylori infection and NAFLD. METHODS: We enrolled patients with NAFLD diagnosed by abdominal B-mode ultrasonography between January and December . H. pylori infection was confirmed by C urea breath test, and liver function, glycometabolism, insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, as well as inflammatory reaction were assessed through blood biochemical analyses. RESULTS: A minority of NAFLD patients had liver dysfunction, increased fasting glucose and insulin levels, a score of insulin-resistance (HOMA-Ir), lipid metabolism, slight inflammatory response, fasting hyperglycemia and hypertension. Most patients were complicated with overweight/visceral obesity and dyslipidemia. Moreover, these abnormal indicators were closely associated with the severity of NAFLD and H. pylori infection. Notably, the prevalence of H. pylori infection showed a significant difference between mild, moderate and severe NAFLD, and hepatic steatosis with coexistent NAFLD also revealed a striking difference between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative patients (P < ). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that H. pylori infection may be an independent risk factor in NAFLD progress.', 'Impact of Helicobacter pylori Infection on the Pathogenesis and Management of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease..

H. pylori infection has been reported to be a risk factor for the development of insulin resistance, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Because treatment for NAFLD, other than weight loss is limited, the treatment for H. pylori infection is well established. It is important to determine whether screening and treatment for H. pylori infection should be considered in patients with no gastrointestinal symptoms.

Fatty liver was diagnosed by ultrasonography. RESULTS: During the , person-years follow-up, participants with H. pylori infection had a higher rate of incident NAFLD than those who were uninfected. In a multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol intake, regular exercise, year of screening exam, and education level, the hazard ratio (HR) for NAFLD development in participants with H. pylori infection compared to those without infection was [% confidence interval (CI), -]. The association persisted after further adjustment for metabolic variables, inflammatory marker, and liver enzymes. The association between H. pylori and NAFLD was still evident in an analysis using fatty liver index as a surrogate marker of NAFLD. In addition, the association between H. pylori infection and incident NAFLD did not differ across clinically relevant subgroups evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection was significantly associated with the development of NAFLD, independent of metabolic and inflammatory risk factors.

Although about years have elapsed since the discovery of the Helicobacter pylori, its diagnosis and the choice of optimal eradication therapy are still to be defined. Over time, there has been an increase in interest, publications, recommendations and guidelines. Moreover, management of the disease in pediatric subjects differs somewhat to that of adults and requires a more delicate approach leading to alternative strategies for both diagnosis and treatment. Which patient should be investigated for H. pylori, when to perform noninvasive or invasive tests, what are the proper therapeutic options and best antibiotics regimen to eradicate the infection are practices changing with evidences through time. Therefore, an updated guideline was published by the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) in . The aim of this review is to highlight what is new and what differs between adult and pediatric population regarding the management of H. pylori infection after the ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guidelines, enriched with updates from literature reviews published over the last two years.', 'Joint ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN Guidelines for the Management of Helicobacter pylori in Children and Adolescents (Update 2016).. BACKGROUND: Because of the changing epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection and low efficacy of currently recommended therapies, an update of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition/North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition recommendations for the diagnosis and management of H pylori infection in children and adolescents is required. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature (time period: -) was performed. Representatives of both societies evaluated the quality of evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to formulate recommendations, which were voted upon and finalized using a Delphi process and face-to-face meeting. RESULTS: The consensus group recommended that invasive diagnostic testing for H pylori be performed only when treatment will be offered if tests are positive. To reach the aim of a % eradication rate with initial therapy, antibiotics should be tailored according to susceptibility testing. Therapy should be administered for days, emphasizing strict adherence. Clarithromycin-containing regimens should be restricted to children infected with susceptible strains. When antibiotic susceptibility profiles are not known, high-dose triple therapy with proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, and metronidazole for days or bismuth-based quadruple therapy is recommended. Success of therapy should be monitored after to weeks by reliable noninvasive tests. CONCLUSIONS: The primary goal of clinical investigation is to identify the cause of upper gastrointestinal symptoms rather than H pylori infection. Therefore, we recommend against a test and treat strategy. Decreasing eradication rates with previously recommended treatments call for changes to first-line therapies and broader availability of culture or molecular-based testing to tailor treatment to the individual child.']",children; pediatric; childhood; infection; guidelines; treatment; adolescents; pylori; is; in,children · pediatric · childhood

In May , upper endoscopy screening showed two elevated lesions on the gastric fundus, and en bloc resection by ESD was performed. We histopathologically diagnosed the patient to have gastric adenocarcinoma of the fundic gland type. In this case, the two lesions of gastric adenocarcinoma of the fundic gland type multifocally developed after ESD for metachronous gastric tubular adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, they appeared in the gastric fundus, where atrophy had been improved due to eradication therapy.', '[A case of gastric-type adenoma with chief cell and parietal cell differentiation surrounded by complete intestinal metaplasia].. A man in his 70s received Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of the stomach. A small, yellowish, protuberant lesion was later observed on the anterior wall of the lower body of the stomach on surveillance esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Narrow band imaging-magnified endoscopy showed an irregular pit and net-like vascular pattern, with the background mucosa having a light blue crest pattern. A biopsy was performed, which led to a diagnosis of adenoma with a gastric phenotype, so repeat ESD was performed. The freshly resected specimen showed a small, protuberant, flat lesion with a clear margin, and hematoxylin and eosin staining showed mild architectural and nuclear atypia. The shape of the atypical gland was similar to that of a fundic gland. MUC5AC, MUC6, pepsinogen A, and H+/K+ ATPase expressions were positive, and CD10 expression was negative, indicating that this tumor could not only differentiate to mucous neck cells but also to chief cells, parietal cells and foveolar epithelium. Therefore, this -mm tumor was diagnosed as a type -IIa tubular adenoma with fundic gland differentiation. The background mucosa showed complete intestinal metaplasia. Traditionally, gastric-type adenoma has been defined as the pyloric gland-type, but our case had a fundic gland phenotype. Therefore, a new fundic-gland adenoma subtype should be considered in this case.', '[Slow progression of gastric adenocarcinoma of fundic gland type: a case report].. Here we report the case of a -year-old male who had undergone esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at a nearby hospital or at our hospital every year since .

Helicobacter pylori (HP) was eradicated in , and the background mucosa around the lesion was endoscopically diagnosed as non-atrophic. We performed endoscopic biopsy of the lesion. Histological examination of the specimen confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma of the fundic gland type. Based on the findings of EGD, ultrasonic endoscopy, and upper gastrointestinal series, we diagnosed that the infiltration of the adenocarcinoma was limited to the mucosa. Hence, we performed endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). After ESD, the resected cancer was located in the mucosa and no invasive lesion was detected at any vessels. Therefore, complete resection was performed through ESD. Retrospectively, the lesion could be detected in the endoscopic images taken in . The shape and diameter of the lesion did not seem to have significantly changed from to . In this case, slow tumor progression was observed. In , no new lesions in the stomach or metastatic area were detected.

The VacA toxin secreted by Helicobacter pylori enhances the ability of the bacteria to colonize the stomach and contributes to the pathogenesis of gastric adenocarcinoma and peptic ulcer disease. The amino acid sequence and structure of VacA are unrelated to corresponding features of other known bacterial toxins. VacA is classified as a pore-forming toxin, and many of its effects on host cells are attributed to formation of channels in intracellular sites. The most extensively studied VacA activity is its capacity to stimulate vacuole formation, but the toxin has many additional effects on host cells. Multiple cell types are susceptible to VacA, including gastric epithelial cells, parietal cells, T cells, and other types of immune cells. This review focuses on the wide range of VacA actions that are detectable in vitro, as well as actions of VacA in vivo that are relevant for H. pylori colonization of the stomach and development of gastric disease.', 'Pleiotropic actions of Helicobacter pylori vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA.. Helicobacter pylori produces a vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA, and most virulent H. pylori strains secrete VacA. VacA binds to two types of receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP), RPTPalpha and RPTPbeta, on the surface of host cells. VacA bound to RPTPbeta, relocates and concentrates in lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. VacA causes vacuolization, membrane anion-selective channel and pore formation, and disruption of endosomal and lysosomal activity in host cells. Secreted VacA is processed into p33 and p55 fragments. The p55 domain not only plays a role in binding to target cells but also in the formation of oligomeric structures and anionic membrane channels. Oral administration of VacA to wild-type mice, but not to RPTPbeta knockout mice, resulted in gastric ulcers, in agreement with the clinical effect of VacA. VacA with s1/m1 allele has more potent cytotoxic activity in relation to peptic ulcer disease and appears to be associated with human gastric cancer. VacA activates pro-apoptotic Bcl- family proteins, and induces apoptosis via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. VacA can disrupt other signal transduction pathways; VacA activates p38 MAPK, enhancing production of IL- and PGE(), and PI3K/Akt, suppressing GSK-3beta activity. VacA has immunomodulatory actions on T cells and other immune cells, possibly contributing to the chronic infection seen with this organism. H. pylori virulence factors including VacA and CagA, which is encoded by cytotoxin-associated gene A, along with host genetic and environmental factors, constitute a complex network to regulate chronic gastric injury and inflammation, which is involved in a multistep process leading to gastric carcinogenesis.', 'Helicobacter pylori Vacuolating Toxin and Gastric Cancer.. Helicobacter pylori VacA is a channel-forming toxin unrelated to other known bacterial toxins. Most H. pylori strains contain a vacA gene, but there is marked variation among strains in VacA toxin activity. This variation is attributable to strain-specific variations in VacA amino acid sequences, as well as variations in the levels of VacA transcription and secretion. In this review, we discuss epidemiologic studies showing an association between specific vacA allelic types and gastric cancer, as well as studies that have used animal models to investigate VacA activities relevant to gastric cancer. We also discuss the mechanisms by which VacA-induced cellular alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.']",vaca; toxin; vacuolating; cytotoxin; cells; vacuolation; p55; membrane; cell; that,vaca · toxin · vacuolating

Helicobacter pylori has an impressive ability to persist chronically in the human stomach. Similar characteristics are associated with biofilm formation in other bacteria. The H. pylori biofilm process, however, is poorly understood. To gain insight into this mode of growth, we carried out comparative transcriptomic analysis between H. pylori biofilm and planktonic cells, using the mouse-colonizing strain SS1. Optimal biofilm formation was obtained with a low concentration of serum and days of growth, conditions that caused both biofilm and planktonic cells to be ∼% coccoid. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis found that % of genes were differentially expressed between biofilm and planktonic cell transcriptomes. Biofilm-downregulated genes included those involved in metabolism and translation, suggesting these cells have low metabolic activity. Biofilm-upregulated genes included those whose products were predicted to be at the cell envelope, involved in regulating a stress response, and surprisingly, genes related to formation of the flagellar apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy visualized flagella that appeared to be a component of the biofilm matrix, supported by the observation that an aflagellated mutant displayed a less robust biofilm with no apparent filaments. We observed flagella in the biofilm matrix of additional H. pylori strains, supporting that flagellar use is widespread. Our data thus support a model in which H. pylori biofilm involves a multigene stress-biased response and that flagella play an important role in H. pylori biofilm formation.IMPORTANCE Biofilms, communities of bacteria that are embedded in a hydrated matrix of extracellular polymeric substances, pose a substantial health risk and are key contributors to many chronic and recurrent infections. Chronicity and recalcitrant infections are also common features associated with the ulcer-causing human pathogen H. pylori However, relatively little is known about the role of biofilms in H. pylori pathogenesis, as well as the biofilm structure itself and the genes associated with this mode of growth. In the present study, we found that H. pylori biofilm cells highly expressed genes related to cell envelope and stress response, as well as those encoding the flagellar apparatus. Flagellar filaments were seen in high abundance in the biofilm. Flagella are known to play a role in initial biofilm formation, but typically are downregulated after that state. H. pylori instead appears to have coopted these structures for nonmotility roles, including a role building a robust biofilm.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Biofilm Formation in Helicobacter pylori.. BACKGROUND: Biofilm formation in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) helps bacteria survive antibiotic exposure and supports bacterial colonization and persistence in the stomach. Most of the published articles have focused on one aspect of the biofilm. Therefore, we conducted the current study to better understand the mechanism of biofilm formation, how the biofilm contributes to antibiotic resistance, and how the biofilm modifies the medication delivery mechanism. METHODS: We conducted a literature review analysis of the published articles on the Helicobacter pylori biofilm between and from the PubMed database to retrieve eligible articles. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, two hundred and seventy-three articles were eligible for our study. RESULTS: The results showed that biofilm formation starts as adhesion and progresses through micro-colonies, maturation, and dispersion in a planktonic form. Moreover, specific genes modulate each phase of biofilm formation. Few studies have shown that mechanisms, such as quorum sensing and diffusible signal factors, enhance coordination among bacteria when switching from biofilm to planktonic states. Different protein expressions were also observed between planktonic and biofilm strains, and the biofilm architecture was supported by exopolysaccharides, extracellular DNA, and outer membrane vesicles. CONCLUSIONS: This infrastructure is responsible for the increased survival of bacteria, especially in harsh environments or in the presence of antibiotics. Therefore, understanding the biofilm formation for H. pylori is crucial. This study illustrates biofilm formation in H. pylori to help improve the treatment of H. pylori infection.', 'Helicobacter pylori Biofilm Formation Is Differentially Affected by Common Culture Conditions, and Proteins Play a Central Role in the Biofilm Matrix.. The concept of Helicobacter pylori biofilm formation is relatively new. To help provide a foundation for future biofilm studies, we characterized the biofilm formation ability of a common H. pylori lab strain, G27. The goal of this study was to evaluate biofilm formation by G27 in response to common culture conditions and to explore the biofilm matrix. Our results indicate that while various types of growth media did not dramatically affect biofilm formation, surface selection had a significant effect on the final biofilm mass. Furthermore, enzymatic assays and confocal microscopy revealed that proteins appear to be the primary structural component of the H. pylori extracellular matrix; extracellular DNA (eDNA) and polysaccharides were also present but appear to play a secondary role. Finally, we found that two well-characterized antibiofilm cationic peptides differentially affected early and late-stage biofilms. Together these results provide interesting avenues for future investigations that will seek to understand H. pylori biofilm formation.IMPORTANCE The study of H. pylori biofilm formation is still in its infancy. As such, there is great variability in how biofilm assays are performed across labs. While several groups have begun to investigate factors that influence H. pylori biofilm formation, it is not yet understood how H. pylori biofilm formation may vary based on commonly used conditions. These inconsistencies lead to difficulties in interpretation and comparison between studies. Here, we set out to characterize biofilm formation by a commonly available lab strain, G27. Our findings provide novel insight into optimal biofilm conditions, the biofilm matrix, and possible mechanisms to block or disrupt biofilm formation.']",biofilm; biofilms; formation; ability; planktonic; that; to; pylori; resistance; biofilmforming,biofilm · biofilms · formation

OBJECTIVE: To comparatively evaluate a new nested set of primers designed for the detection of Helicobacter pylori targeting a highly conserved heat shock protein gene (Hsp60). METHODS: A total of subjects having peptic ulcer diseases were tested for the detection of H. pylori using rapid urease test (RUT), histology, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in their antral biopsy specimens. A newly designed Hsp60 gene-based primer set was evaluated against commonly used PCR primers for detection of H. pylori. RESULTS: Forty-six of the study subjects were found positive for culture isolation and all the culture-positive specimens were also positive with Hsp60 gene PCR. Of the culture-positive specimens, were positive for 16S rRNA gene, ureC gene, RUT, and histology whereas only were positive with ureA gene PCR. Of the culture-negative subjects, were positive with 16S rRNA gene, were positive with ureC (glmM) gene PCR, and were positive with RUT and was positive on histology. CONCLUSION: This study shows that nested amplification targeting Hsp60 gene is the most sensitive and specific with LR+ and LR- values of proportional, variant and , respectively, when compared with the other three PCR methods. Also, HSP60 gene-specific nested protocol was the most appropriate for detection of H. pylori in clinical specimens. This is particularly valuable because it can be used as a noninvasive method for detecting H. pylori infection in young children and also, in follow-up studies with peptic ulcer patients, on samples like feces and saliva.', 'Diagnostic reliability of nested PCR depends on the primer design and threshold abundance of Helicobacter pylori in biopsy, stool, and saliva samples.. BACKGROUND: The aim of this work was to find a reliable nested PCR for the detection of Helicobacter pylori in biopsy, stool, and saliva specimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Novel nested PCR was elaborated and validated on clinical biopsy, stool, and saliva samples from the same individual and compared to available H pylori assays: histology, rapid urease test (RUT), stool antigen test (SAT), C-urea breath test (UBT). RESULTS: The efficiency and selectivity of published nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) available for Helicobacter pylori detection were re-evaluated. Most of them had serious limitations and mistakes in primer design. Hence, we elaborated a nested PCR for the unambiguous identification of H pylori in biopsy, stool, and saliva, using primers targeted to variable regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Moreover, we determined the detection limit by adding a known number of cells. This number was as low as cells in a PCR vial, but due to the DNA isolation procedures, it required - × cells/g or ml of specimen. The sensitivity for nested PCR from stomach biopsies was on the same scale as C-UBT (%), but it was much lower in amplifications from stool (%). Sequencing of all obtained PCR products exclusively confirmed H pylori-specific DNA sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Elaborated nested PCR assay can serve as an auxiliary method for controversial samples (patients with bleeding or taking proton-pump inhibitor) in laboratories with basic equipment. The sensitivity and specificity for the amplification from gastric biopsies was almost like C-UBT. Despite the good sensitivity, the threshold occurrence and the ability to survive in the oral cavity aside from and independent of the stomach is the reason why H pylori DNA cannot be reliably detected in saliva, stool, and some biopsy samples.', 'DNA diagnostics for reliable and universal identification of Helicobacter pylori.. Reliable diagnostics are a major challenge for the detection and treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Currently at the forefront are non-invasive urea breath test (UBT) and stool antigen test (SAT). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is not endorsed due to nonspecific primers and the threat of false-positives. The specificity of DNA amplification can be achieved by nested PCR (NPCR), which involves two rounds of PCR. If the primers are properly designed for the variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene, it is not difficult to develop an NPCR assay for the unambiguous identification of H. pylori. Elaborate NPCR for a bp amplicon was validated on clinical biopsy, stool, and saliva samples, each from the same individuals, and compared with available H. pylori assays, namely histology, rapid urease test, SAT, and 13C-UBT. The assay was much more sensitive than simple PCR, and it was equally sensitive in biopsy samples as the 13C-UBT test, which is considered the gold standard. In addition, it is sufficiently specific because sequencing of the PCR products exclusively confirmed the presence of H. pylori-specific DNA. However, due to the threshold and lower abundance, the sensitivity was much lower in amplifications from stool or saliva. Reliable detection in saliva also complicates the ability of H. pylori to survive in the oral cavity aside from and independent of the stomach. The reason for the lower sensitivity in stool is DNA degradation; therefore, a new NPCR assay was developed to obtain a shorter bp 16S rRNA amplicon. The assay was validated on stool samples from gastroenterological patients and compared to SAT results. Surprisingly, this NPCR revealed the presence of H. pylori in twice the number of samples as SAT, indicating that many patients are misdiagnosed, not treated by antibiotics, and their problems are interpreted as chronic. Thus, it is unclear how to properly diagnose H. pylori in practice. In the first approach, SAT or UBT is sufficient. If samples are negative, the bp amplicon NPCR assay should be performed. If problems persist, patients should not be considered negative, but due to threshold H. pylori abundance, they should be periodically tested. The advantage of NPCR over UBT is that it can be used universally, including questionable samples taken from patients with achlorhydria, receiving proton pump inhibitors, antibiotics, bismuth compound, intestinal metaplasia, or gastric ulcer bleeding.']",pcr; detection; dna; samples; 16s; qpcr; stool; realtime; specimens; rrna,pcr · detection · dna

OBJECTIVES: There are contradictory reports on the relationship between Helicobacter pylori and circulating ghrelin. We sought to clarify the influence of H. pylori infection on gastric and plasma ghrelin dynamics in humans. METHODS: Using endoscopic biopsies from the corpus of H. pylori-infected patients and uninfected subjects, ghrelin mRNA expression levels and gastric ghrelin peptide contents were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and radioimmunoassay, respectively. We also measured plasma ghrelin concentrations and analyzed the numbers of ghrelin immunoreactive cells in the fundic gland area. Fifty-one patients with H. pylori infection were treated with a -day triple therapy consisting of lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. RESULTS: The gastric ghrelin mRNA expression level of H. pylori-positive patients ( +/- in arbitrary units) was significantly lower than in H. pylori-negative subjects ( +/- , p < ). A similar trend was noted for ghrelin peptide contents ( +/- vs +/- ng/mg protein, respectively, p < ). There was no significant difference in the number of ghrelin immunoreactive cells/mm() in terms of H. plyori status. Plasma ghrelin concentrations in H. pylori-infected patients ( +/- . fmol/ml) were significantly lower than in uninfected subjects ( +/- , p < ) and increased following cure of the infection. Plasma ghrelin levels correlated positively with the expression levels of ghrelin mRNA (r = , p < ) and peptide products (r = , p < ). There was a significant stepwise decrease in gastric ghrelin mRNA expression (p < ), peptide contents (p < ) and density of ghrelin immunoreactive cells (p < ) with progression of histological severity of glandular atrophy in the corpus. The histological severity of chronic inflammation also negatively influenced the ghrelin mRNA expression (p < ) and peptide production (p < ). CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection has a negative impact on gastric and plasma ghrelin dynamics. Chronic inflammatory and atrophic changes associated with the infection may affect gastric ghrelin biosynthesis and contribute to the low circulating levels.', 'Changes in plasma ghrelin levels, gastric ghrelin production, and body weight after Helicobacter pylori cure.. BACKGROUND: Ghrelin is a body weight-regulating peptide produced and secreted primarily by the gastric mucosa. Helicobacter pylori infection impairs gastric ghrelin production, leading to a lower plasma ghrelin concentration. However, the effect of H. pylori eradication on plasma ghrelin levels and its relation to body weight change after H. pylori cure are still uncertain. We examined the association of plasma ghrelin levels with gastric ghrelin production and body weight change before and after H. pylori eradication. METHODS: Plasma ghrelin concentrations, gastric ghrelin expression, and body weight were determined in a total of consecutive individuals before and weeks after successful H. pylori eradication. Gastric ghrelin expression was evaluated by determining mRNA expression levels and the number of ghrelin-producing cells in gastric mucosa biopsy specimens by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: Plasma ghrelin concentration increased in patients and decreased in patients after H. pylori eradication. After H. pylori cure, however, gastric preproghrelin mRNA expression was increased nearly fourfold (P < ), and the number of ghrelin-positive cells was increased or unchanged. In contrast, plasma ghrelin changes after H. pylori cure were inversely correlated with both body weight change (P < ) and initial plasma ghrelin levels (P < ). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in plasma ghrelin concentrations before and after H. pylori cure were inversely correlated with body weight change and initial plasma ghrelin levels but not with gastric ghrelin production in Japanese patients.', 'Ghrelin and Helicobacter pylori infection.. Ghrelin is primarily secreted from the stomach and has been implicated in the coordination of eating behavior and weight regulation. Ghrelin also plays an essential role in the mechanism of gastric mucosal defense. Thus, it is important to clarify which diseases primarily influence changes in plasma ghrelin concentrations. Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection is involved in the pathogenesis of gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer, gastric carcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. H pylori eradication is related to body weight change. Compared, H pylori infected and negative subjects with normal body mass index, plasma ghrelin concentration, gastric ghrelin mRNA, and the number of ghrelin producing cells in gastric mucosa are significantly lower in H pylori infected subjects than in H pylori-negative controls. Plasma ghrelin concentration decreases with the progression of gastric atrophy. Impaired gastric ghrelin production in association with atrophic gastritis induced by H pylori infection accounts for the decrease in plasma ghrelin concentration. However, the ratio of plasma acylated ghrelin to total ghrelin levels is higher in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis than in healthy subjects. This may result from the compensatory increase in plasma active ghrelin concentration in response to gastric atrophy. After H pylori eradication, gastric preproghrelin mRNA expression is increased nearly -fold in most cases. However, changes in plasma ghrelin concentrations before and after H pylori cure are not associated with the gastric ghrelin production. Plasma ghrelin changes are inversely correlated with both body weight change and initial plasma ghrelin levels.']",ghrelin; plasma; leptin; levels; serum; body; circulating; hormone; acylated; weight,ghrelin · plasma · leptin

With the development of endoscopic diagnosis, there is a shortage of specialists who can perform high-precision endoscopy. We will examine whether AI with excellent image recognition ability can overcome this problem. AREAS COVERED: Since , papers on artificial intelligence using convolutional neural network (CNN in other word Deep Learning) have been published. CNN is generally capable of more accurate detection and classification than conventional machine learning. This is a review of papers using CNN in the gastrointestinal endoscopy area, along with the reasons why AI is required in clinical practice. We divided this review into four parts: stomach, esophagus, large intestine, and capsule endoscope (small intestine). EXPERT OPINION: Potential applications for the AI include colorectal polyp detection and differentiation, gastric and esophageal cancer detection, and lesion detection in capsule endoscopy. The accuracy of endoscopic diagnosis will increase if the AI and endoscopist perform the endoscopy together."", ""Artificial intelligence for cancer detection of the upper gastrointestinal tract.. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been found to be useful to physicians in the field of image recognition due to three elements: deep learning (that is, CNN, convolutional neural network), a high-performance computer, and a large amount of digitized data. In the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy, Japanese endoscopists have produced the world's first achievements of CNN-based AI system for detecting gastric and esophageal cancers. This study reviews papers on CNN-based AI for gastrointestinal cancers, and discusses the future of this technology in clinical practice. Employing AI-based endoscopes would enable early cancer detection. The better diagnostic abilities of AI technology may be beneficial in early gastrointestinal cancers in which endoscopists have variable diagnostic abilities and accuracy. AI coupled with the expertise of endoscopists would increase the accuracy of endoscopic diagnosis.""]",ai; images; artificial; intelligence; accuracy; learning; cnn; model; neural; endoscopists,images · artificial · intelligence

Enzymatic characterization with crystal structure analysis.. The meso-diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DAPDC, EC .) catalyzes the final step of L-lysine biosynthesis in bacteria and is regarded as a target for the discovery of antibiotics. Here we report the 3A crystal structure of DAPDC from Helicobacter pylori (HpDAPDC). The structure, in which the product L-lysine forms a Schiff base with the cofactor pyridoxal \'-phosphate, provides structural insight into the substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, and implies that the carboxyl to be cleaved locates at the si face of the cofactor. To our knowledge, this might be the first reported external aldimine of DAPDC. Moreover, the active site loop of HpDAPDC is in a ""down"" conformation and shields the ligand from solvent. Mutations of Ile() from the loop greatly impaired the catalytic efficiency. Combining the structural analysis of the I148L mutant, we hypothesize that HpDAPDC adopts an induced-fit catalytic mechanism in which this loop cycles through ""down"" and ""up"" conformations to stabilize intermediates and release product, respectively. Our work is expected to provide clues for designing specific inhibitors of DAPDC.', 'Structural basis for substrate binding and the catalytic mechanism of type III pantothenate kinase.. Pantothenate kinase (PanK) catalyzes the first step of the universal five-step coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthetic pathway. The recently characterized type III PanK (PanK-III, encoded by the coaX gene) is distinct in sequence, structure and enzymatic properties from both the long-known bacterial type I PanK (PanK-I, exemplified by the Escherichia coli CoaA protein) and the predominantly eukaryotic type II PanK (PanK-II). PanK-III enzymes have an unusually high Km for ATP, are resistant to feedback inhibition by CoA, and are unable to utilize the N-alkylpantothenamide family of pantothenate analogues as alternative substrates, thus making type III PanK ineffective in generating CoA analogues as antimetabolites in vivo. Previously, we reported the crystal structure of the PanK-III from Thermotoga maritima and identified it as a member of the ""acetate and sugar kinase/heat shock protein /actin"" (ASKHA) superfamily. Here we report the crystal structures of the same PanK-III in complex with one of its substrates (pantothenate), its product (phosphopantothenate) as well as a ternary complex structure of PanK-III with pantothenate and ADP. These results are combined with isothermal titration calorimetry experiments to present a detailed structural and thermodynamic characterization of the interactions between PanK-III and its substrates ATP and pantothenate. Comparison of substrate binding and catalytic sites of PanK-III with that of eukaryotic PanK-II revealed drastic differences in the binding modes for both ATP and pantothenate substrates, and suggests that these differences may be exploited in the development of new inhibitors specifically targeting PanK-III.', ""Structural insights into substrate binding, residue contributions, and catalytic mechanism of phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase from Helicobacter pylori.. Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) (PPAT; EC .) is a key enzyme in coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis. It catalyzes the reversible transfer of an adenylyl group from ATP to '-phosphopantetheine (Ppant), producing pyrophosphate and '-dephospho-CoA (dPCoA). Although the crystal structures of PPATs with various ligands have been studied, the specific contributions of residues to catalytic efficiency remain unclear. Here, we present the crystal structures of Helicobacter pylori PPAT (HpPPAT) in its apo form and complexes with Ppant and ATP. Additionally, we report the structure of the HpPPAT P8A mutant bound to dPCoA, providing the first complete occupancy structure of a PPAT complex across the hexamer. In the HpPPAT:ATP complex structure, critical active site residues Thr10, His18, Arg88, and Arg91, conserved in Escherichia coli PPAT (EcPPAT), are identified. HpPPAT utilizes Pro8, Lys42, and Arg133 for ATP binding. This differs from the binding pattern observed in other bacterial PPATs. Mutations of these residues, except for Thr10 and Lys42, resulted in a complete loss of enzymatic activity. This result highlights their critical roles. Mutating Thr10 and Lys42 to alanine reduced catalytic efficiency compared to WT HpPPAT but retained substantial activity. These residues are expected to orient the nucleophile for an in-line displacement mechanism. Based on structural studies and mutagenesis data with kinetic measurements and insights from other bacterial PPATs, we propose a refined catalytic mechanism for HpPPAT that emphasizes species-specific active-site interactions. This mechanism provides a foundation structure-based drugs H. pylori infections.""]",structure; enzyme; crystal; catalytic; structural; substrate; residues; binding; site; biosynthesis,structure · enzyme · crystal

Following a similar approach on carvacrol-based derivatives, we investigated the synthesis and the microbiological screening against eight strains of H. pylori, and the cytotoxic activity against human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells of a new series of ether compounds based on the structure of thymol. Structural analysis comprehended elemental analysis and 1H/13C/19F NMR spectra. The analysis of structure-activity relationships within this molecular library of structurally-related compounds reported that some chemical modifications of the OH group of thymol led to broad-spectrum growth inhibition on all isolates. Preferred substitutions were benzyl groups compared to alkyl chains, and the specific presence of functional groups at para position of the benzyl moiety such as -CN and -Ph endowed the most anti-H. pylori activity toward all the strains with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values up to µg/mL. Poly-substitution on the benzyl ring was not essential. Moreover, several compounds characterized by the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC) values against H. pylori were also tested in order to verify a cytotoxic effect against AGS cells with respect to -fluorouracil and carvacrol.

The activity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated against clinically isolated metronidazole-resistant H. pylori strains.

Levodopa is the gold standard for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). There are well documented motor and non-motor fluctuations, however, that occur almost inevitably once levodopa is started after a variable period in people with PD. Whilst brain neurodegenerative processes play a part in the pathogenesis of these fluctuations, a range of barriers across the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can alter levodopa pharmacokinetics, ultimately contributing to non-optimal levodopa response and symptoms fluctuations. GI barriers to levodopa transport and absorption include dysphagia, delayed gastric emptying, constipation, Helicobacter pylori infection, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and gut dysbiosis. In addition, a protein-rich diet and concomitant medication intake can further alter levodopa pharmacokinetics. This can result in unpredictable or sub-optimal levodopa response, 'delayed on' or 'no on' phenomena. In this narrative review, we provided an overview on the plethora of GI obstacles to levodopa transport and absorption in PD and their implications on levodopa pharmacokinetics and development of motor fluctuations. In addition, management strategies to address GI dysfunction in PD are highlighted, including use of non-oral therapies to bypass the GI tract."", ""Clinical implications of gastric complications on levodopa treatment in Parkinson's disease.. Disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are common and distressing nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) that can adversely affect levodopa absorption and lead to OFF periods, also known as motor fluctuations. Gastroparesis, which is primarily defined as delayed gastric emptying (DGE), and Helicobacter pylori infection, which is present with increased frequency in PD, are among the most common and important GI disorders reported in PD that may impair oral levodopa absorption and increase OFF time. Symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, postprandial bloating, fullness, early satiety, abdominal pain, and weight loss. DGE has been reported in a substantial fraction of individuals with PD. Symptoms of H. pylori infection include gastritis and peptic ulcers. Studies have found that DGE and H. pylori infection are correlated with delayed peak levodopa plasma levels and increased incidence of motor fluctuations. Therapeutic strategies devised to minimize the potential that gastric complications will impair oral levodopa absorption and efficacy in PD patients include treatments that circumvent the GI tract, such as apomorphine injection, levodopa intestinal gel delivery, levodopa inhalation powder, and deep brain stimulation. Other strategies aim at improving gastric emptying in PD patients, primarily including prokinetic agents."", ""Stomaching the Possibility of a Pathogenic Role for Helicobacter pylori in Parkinson's Disease.. While a small subset of Parkinson's disease cases have genetic causes, most cases are sporadic and may have an environmental contributor that has largely remained enigmatic. Remarkably, gastrointestinal symptoms in PD patients serve as a prodrome for the eventual motor dysfunctions. Herein, we review studies exploring a possible link between the gastric human pathogen Helicobacter pylori and PD. We provide plausible and testable hypotheses for how this organism might contribute to PD: ) a toxin(s) produced by the bacteria; ) disruption of the intestinal microbiome; ) local inflammation that crosses the gut-brain axis, leading to neuroinflammation; and ) manipulation of the pharmacokinetics of the PD drug levodopa by H. pylori, even in those not receiving exogenous levodopa. Key findings are: ) people with PD are --fold more likely to be infected with H. pylori than people without PD; ) H. pylori-infected PD patients display worse motor functions than H. pylori-negative PD patients; ) eradication of H. pylori improves motor function in PD patients over PD patients whose H. pylori was not eradicated; and ) eradication of H. pylori improves levodopa absorption in PD patients compared to that of PD patients whose H. pylori was not eradicated. Evidence is accumulating that H. pylori has a link with PD, but the mechanism is unclear.

OBJECTIVES: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori is influenced by susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, elevated bacterial load and degree of acid inhibition, which can be affected by genotypes of drug-metabolizing enzymes [cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 polymorphism]. Theoretically, the choice and dose of proton pump inhibitor may also influence the suppression of H. pylori infection. The CYP2C19 genotype has recently been found to have an impact on peptic ulcer healing, H. pylori eradication and therapeutic efficacy of proton pump inhibitors. METHODS: Here, we investigated the impact of the CYP2C19 genotype polymorphism and the success of triple therapy (fluoroquinolones/metronidazole/clarithromycin) on antibiotic-resistant strains in eradicating H. pylori in human subjects with non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD), in human subjects with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and in asymptomatic human subjects (positive and negative for H. pylori infection). RESULTS: Based on the CYP2C19 genotypes, determined by Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) analysis, we found %, % and % corresponding to rapid metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers and poor metabolizers, respectively. However, we did not find any significant effect for homozygous ABCB1 or CYP2C19* and CYP2C19* alleles. We detected several participants heterozygous for both ABCB1 and CYP2C19*, CYP2C19* and CYP2C19* loci. The participants heterozygous for both ABCB1 and CYP2C19* and * loci should be defined as intermediate and poor metabolizers according to the haplotype analysis in the NUD, PUD and asymptomatic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, fluoroquinolones/metronidazole/clarithromycin-based triple therapies can be used to eradicate H. pylori infection, if one does not know the CYP2C19 genotype of the patient.', 'Effect of CYP2C19*17 gene variant on Helicobacter pylori eradication in peptic ulcer patients.. OBJECTIVE: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori is an important treatment strategy in peptic ulcer patients. Current regimens of eradication consist of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotics. The principal enzyme involved in PPIs metabolism is CYP2C19, which exhibits an interindividual variability of activity, mainly due to genetic polymorphism. Two alleles (CYP2C19* and CYP2C19*), responsible for slow PPIs metabolism, were previously associated with higher efficacy of eradication. Recently, a novel CYP2C19 gene variant (CYP2C19*), associated with faster metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates, was described. In the present study, a potential association between CYP2C19* allele and lower H. pylori eradication efficacy was tested in a group of peptic ulcer patients. METHODS: A total of peptic ulcer patients, positive for H. pylori infection, were treated with triple therapy (pantoprazole+amoxicillin+metronidazole). Subsequently, the patients were divided into two groups (group - success, and group - failure of eradication after therapy) and genotyped for the presence of CYP2C19 variant alleles (*, *, and *). RESULTS: Frequency of CYP2C19 alleles in two groups of patients were: versus (p=) for *, versus (p=) for *, and versus (p=) for * allele, respectively. CYP2C19* was not detected in the evaluated population. No significant differences in frequency nor distribution of * allele were found between two groups of patients. CYP2C19* allele was associated with successful H. pylori eradication (p<), * allele carriers were found to be over -times more prone to the treatment compared to */* homozygotes (OR=, p=). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, contrary to CYP2C19*, CYP2C19* allele has no impact on efficacy of H. pylori eradication in peptic ulcer patients treated with pantoprazole.', 'CYP2C19 polymorphism influences Helicobacter pylori eradication.. The known factors that have contributed to the decline of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication rate include antibiotic resistance, poor compliance, high gastric acidity, high bacterial load, and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) polymorphism. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is important in the eradication regimen. The principal enzyme implicated in the metabolism of PPIs is CYP2C19. The effects of PPI depend on metabolic enzyme, cytochrome P450 enzymes, and CYP2C19 with genetic differences in the activity of this enzyme (the homozygous EM, heterozygous EM (HetEM), and poor metabolizer). The frequency of the CYP2C19 polymorphism is highly varied among different ethnic populations. The CYP2C19 genotype is a cardinal factor of H. pylori eradication in patients taking omeprazole- based or lansoprazole-based triple therapies. In contrast, the CYP2C19 polymorphism has no significant effect on the rabeprazole-based or esomeprazole-based triple therapies. The efficacy of levofloxacin-based rescue triple therapy might be also affected by the CYP2C19 polymorphism, but CYP2C19 genotypes did not show obvious impact on other levofloxacin-based rescue therapies. Choice of different PPIs and/or increasing doses of PPIs should be individualized based on the pharmacogenetics background of each patient and pharmacological profile of each drug. Other possible factors influencing gastric acid secretion (e.g., IL-1β- polymorphism) would be also under consideration.']",cyp2c19; metabolizers; polymorphism; genotype; eradication; pm; mdr1; polymorphisms; metabolizer; extensive,cyp2c19 · metabolizers · polymorphism

Data on the prevalence of infections were derived from cross-sectional surveys of the Italian population, and relative risks from meta-analyses and large-scale studies. Attributable fractions were calculated based on the counterfactual scenario of a lack of infection.

We estimated the PAFs for each infectious agent on the basis of representative data on prevalence and risk-outcome associations assuming a latency period of years. Overall, % of cancer cases in in Japan were attributable to the infectious agents included in this analysis. The estimated PAF was slightly higher in men (%) than in women (%). The highest proportion of cancer deaths attributable to infectious agents was observed for H. pylori infection, followed by HBV/HCV, and HPV infection. Our findings corroborated with previous estimates that H. pylori and HBV/HCV infections were the two most important infectious agents in the Japanese population.

Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for currently and ever having asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergy symptoms in the previous year, and allergen-specific skin sensitization were computed comparing participants seropositive for cagA(-) or cagA(+) strains of H pylori with those without H pylori. RESULTS: The presence of cagA(+) H pylori strains was inversely related to ever having asthma (OR, ; % confidence interval [CI], -), and the inverse association of cagA positivity with childhood-onset (age </= years) asthma was stronger (OR, ; % CI, -) than that with adult-onset asthma (OR, ; % CI, -). Colonization with H pylori, especially with a cagA(+) strain, was inversely associated with currently (OR, ; % CI, -) or ever (OR, ; % CI, -) having a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, especially for childhood onset (OR, ; % CI, -). Consistent inverse associations were found between H pylori colonization and the presence of allergy symptoms in the previous year and sensitization to pollens and molds. CONCLUSION: These observations support the hypothesis that childhood acquisition of H pylori is associated with reduced risks of asthma and allergy.']",asthma; allergic; atopy; allergy; ige; atopic; children; childhood; between; inverse,asthma · allergic · atopy

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Accumulating evidence indicates that a variety of infections contribute to the pathogenesis of glaucoma. The role of Helicobacter pylori infection in glaucoma is controversial. DESIGN: Prospective, population-based study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with various types of glaucoma and a control group of patients with cataract. METHODS: We evaluated seropositivity to H. pylori and to its cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) product in patients with various types of glaucoma and compared the findings to those of a control group of patients with cataract. RESULTS: H. pylori infection and CagA seropositivity were detected in / (%) and / (%) glaucoma patients compared with / (%) and / (%) control patients, respectively (P=, , not significant). Similar rates of H. pylori infection and CagA-positive strain were found in all glaucoma subgroups, and none of them was statistically different from those of controls. CONCLUSIONS: Neither H. pylori infection nor seropositivity for virulent CagA-bearing H. pylori strains have significant association with the occurrence of glaucoma of any type.', 'The role of the microbiota in glaucoma.. Glaucoma is a common irreversible vision loss disorder because of the gradual loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the optic nerve axons. Major risk factors include elder age and high intraocular pressure (IOP). However, high IOP is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause glaucoma. Some non-IOP signaling cascades can mediate RGC degeneration. In addition, gender, diet, obesity, depression, or anxiety also contribute to the development of glaucoma. Understanding the mechanism of glaucoma development is crucial for timely diagnosis and establishing new strategies to improve current IOP-reducing therapies. The microbiota exerts a marked influence on the human body during homeostasis and disease. Many glaucoma patients have abnormal compositions of the microbiota (dysbiosis) in multiple locations, including the ocular surface, intraocular cavity, oral cavity, stomach, and gut. Here, we discuss findings in the last ten years or more about the microbiota and metabolite changes in animal models, patients with three risk factors (aging, obesity, and depression), and glaucoma patients. Antigenic mimicry and heat stress protein (HSP)-specific T-cell infiltration in the retina may be responsible for commensal microbes contributing to glaucomatous RGC damage. LPS-TLR4 pathway may be the primary mechanism of oral and ocular surface dysbiosis affecting glaucoma. Microbe-derived metabolites may also affect glaucoma pathogenesis. Homocysteine accumulation, inflammatory factor release, and direct dissemination may link gastric H. pylori infection and anterior chamber viral infection (such as cytomegalovirus) to glaucoma. Potential therapeutic protocols targeting microbiota include antibiotics, modified diet, and stool transplant. Later investigations will uncover the underlying molecular mechanism connecting dysbiosis to glaucoma and its clinical applications in glaucoma management.', 'Association between Active Helicobacter pylori Infection and Glaucoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.. Background: Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness worldwide affecting almost million individuals. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a widespread pathogen with systematic pathogenicity. This meta-analysis aimed to estimate the contradictory data regarding a potential association between active H. pylori infection and glaucoma. Materials and Methods: A research in MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted and original studies investigating the relationship between H. pylori infection and glaucoma were included. Analysis was performed with random effects model. The main outcome was the odds ratio (OR) with % confidence intervals (CI) of H. pylori infection as a risk factor for glaucoma. A parallel analysis studied the role of active infection as indicated by histology and the titer of anti-H. pylori antibodies. For the anti-H. pylori antibody titers, weighted mean differences (WMD) were estimated between patients and controls. Results: Fifteen studies were included, with participants ( patients with glaucoma and controls), divided into primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), normal tension glaucoma (NTG) and pseudo-exfoliation glaucoma (PEG). The association between H. pylori infection and overall glaucoma was significant (OR = , CI % -) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = %). After stratification by glaucoma subtype, heterogeneity was eliminated in the NTG subgroup. Studies with healthy controls, and controls with anemia yielded very low or no heterogeneity, respectively. Gastric biopsy to document active H. pylori infection yielded the highest OR (, CI: -, p < ) and null heterogeneity. For anti-H. pylori antibody titers, there was a significant difference in WMD between patients and controls (WMD IU/mL; % CI: -; p = ); values were greater in glaucoma patients, with high heterogeneity (I2: %). Meta-regression analysis showed that mean age had a significant impact on glaucoma (p = ). Conclusions: Active H. pylori infection may be associated with glaucoma with null heterogeneity, as, beyond histology, quantified by anti-H. pylori titers and increases with age.']",glaucoma; serous; csc; chorioretinopathy; poag; central; cscr; retinal; control; aau,glaucoma · serous · csc

Bismuth salts exert their activity within the upper gastrointestinal tract through action of luminal bismuth. Bismuth exerts direct bactericidal effect on Helicobacter pylori by different ways: forms complexes in the bacterial wall and periplasmic space, inhibits different enzymes, ATP synthesis, and adherence of the bacteria to the gastric mucosa. Bismuth also helps ulcer healing by acting as a barrier to the aggressive factors and increasing mucosal protective factors such as prostaglandin, epidermal growth factor, and bicarbonate secretion. To date, no resistance to bismuth has been reported. Also synergism between bismuth salts and antibiotics was present. It was shown that metronidazole and clarithromycin resistant H. pylori strains become susceptible if they are administered together with bismuth. Bismuth-containing quadruple therapy was recommended both by the Second Asia-Pacific Consensus Guidelines and by the Maastricht IV/Florence Consensus Report as an alternative first choice regimen to standard triple therapy, in areas with low clarithromycin resistance, and it is recommended as the first-line therapeutic option in areas with a high prevalence of clarithromycin resistance. Greater than % eradication success can be obtained by bismuth-containing quadruple therapy. Choosing bismuth as an indispensable part of first-line therapy is logical as both metronidazole and clarithromycin resistances can be overcome by adding bismuth to the regimen.', ""A proteomic approach for the identification of bismuth-binding proteins in Helicobacter pylori.. Helicobacter pylori is a major human pathogen that can cause peptic ulcers and chronic gastritis. Bismuth-based triple or quadruple therapies are commonly recommended for the treatment of H. pylori infections. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying treatment with bismuth are currently not fully understood. We have conducted a detailed comparative proteomic analysis of H. pylori cells both before and after treatment with colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS). Eight proteins were found to be significantly upregulated or downregulated in the presence of CBS ( microg mL(-)). Bismuth-induced oxidative stress was confirmed by detecting higher levels of lipid hydroperoxide (approximately times) and hemin (approximately times), in whole cell extracts of bismuth-treated H. pylori cells, compared with those from untreated cells. The presence of bismuth also led to an approximately eightfold decrease in cellular protease activities. Using immobilized-bismuth affinity chromatography, we isolated and subsequently identified seven bismuth-binding proteins from H. pylori cell extracts. The intracellular levels of four of these proteins (HspA, HspB, NapA and TsaA) were influenced by the addition of CBS, which strongly suggests that they interact directly with bismuth. The other bismuth-interacting proteins identified were two enzymes (fumarase and the urease subunit UreB), and a translational factor (Ef-Tu). Our data suggest that the inhibition of proteases, modulation of cellular oxidative stress and interference with nickel homeostasis may be key processes underlying the molecular mechanism of bismuth's actions against H. pylori."", 'In Vitro Susceptibility and Synergistic Effect of Bismuth Against Helicobacter pylori.. Background/objectives: Bismuth is commonly used in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy. However, few studies have examined the in vitro susceptibility of H. pylori to bismuth. Moreover, the exact mechanism of action of bismuth on H. pylori remains unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the anti-bacterial effect of bismuth as well as to evaluate potential synergistic effects between bismuth and various antibiotics. Methods: The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of three bismuth preparations, bismuth subsalicylate, bismuth potassium citrate, and colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS, De-Nol) were determined for H. pylori strains using the agar dilution technique. Agar plates of varying pH values from to were used to investigate whether acidity influences the anti-bacterial effect of bismuth. A checkerboard assay was performed to assess the synergism between CBS and antibiotics (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole). Results: Twelve H. pylori strains, including three reference strains (H. pylori , J99, and ATCC ), and nine clinically isolated strains were tested. The MICs for bismuth subsalicylate, bismuth potassium citrate, and CBS ranged from to μg/mL, to μg/mL, and to μg/mL, respectively. The bismuth MICs for the reference strains were similar at pH -. In the checkerboard assay, no interactions between CBS and any of the antibiotics were observed in the reference H. pylori strains. Conclusions: Bismuth showed in vitro susceptibility against H. pylori. The enhanced eradication efficacy of bismuth-containing regimens appears to be due to mechanisms other than direct synergy with antibiotics.']",bismuth; complexes; bi; cbs; bismuthiii; drugs; compounds; activity; against; biiii,bismuth · complexes · cbs

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies have reported the association between limited number of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) antigens and gastric cancer (GC) risk. The present study evaluated the association between serum antibodies against different H. pylori proteins measured by using multiplex serology assay and GC risk. METHODS: We searched PubMed databases, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for relevant articles. A meta-analysis was used to pool studies and to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with % confidence intervals (%CIs) of different H. pylori antigens associated with GC risk. Heterogeneity was investigated using Cochran's Q test and I-squared statistic. RESULTS: Nine studies were identified, with a total of GC cases and controls. Five H. pylori virulence factors were significantly associated with non-cardia GC risk at p-value < including: CagA (OR = , %CI: -), HP0305 (OR = , %CI: -), HyuA (OR = , %CI: -), Omp (OR = , %CI: -), and VacA (OR = , %CI: -). However, none of the antigens was associated with cardia GC risk. In subgroup analysis by ethnicity, we identified antigens associated with the risk of non-cardia GC among East Asian while only two antigens were identified in European population. Nevertheless, CagA and GroEL showed a stronger association in Caucasian (CagA OR = , %CI: -; GroEL OR = , %CI: -) compared with East Asian (CagA OR = , % CI: -; GroEL OR = , %CI: -). CONCLUSIONS: This study determined that H. pylori infection increases the risk of non-cardia GC with differential effects by its virulence factors and with different patterns among East Asian and European populations.

Infection with Helicobacter pylori is a major cause of gastric cancer (GC). The association likely has been underestimated in the past due to disease-related clearance of the infection. On the other hand, only a minority of the infected individuals develop GC, and better risk stratification is therefore highly desirable. We aimed to assess the association of GC with antibodies to individual H. pylori proteins, determined by novel multiplex serology, to identify potentially relevant risk markers. This analysis was based on GC cases aged to years and age-matched and sex-matched controls from Saarland, Germany. Eight of the antibodies were significantly associated with noncardia GC and seven of them were significantly related to GC at any site. More pronounced associations were observed for noncardia GC; adjusted odds ratios (% confidence intervals) ranged from (-) for HyuA to (-) for cytotoxin-associated antigen A (CagA). A dose-response relationship was found between the number of seropositivities and GC (P < ). The seropositivities of CagA and GroEL were found to be independent predictors of GC, which were strongly related to GC risk in a dose-response manner (P < ). In conclusion, GroEL was identified as a new independent risk marker that may contribute to enhanced quantification of H. pylori-related GC risk.', 'Association of Antibody Responses to Helicobacter pylori Proteins with Colorectal Adenoma and Colorectal Cancer.. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. Here, the association of immune responses to bacterial exposure with advancing stages of colorectal neoplasia was assessed by multiplex serology. Immunoglobulin (Ig) A and G antibody responses to thirteen proteins of H. pylori were measured by a Luminex-based multiplex assay in plasma from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC, n = ), advanced adenoma (n = ), or small polyps (n = ) and controls (n = ). Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association of bacterial seropositivity with colorectal neoplasia. The threshold for overall seropositivity required subjects to be positive for at least out of the tested antigens. In a cohort subset with matched data (n = ), H. pylori seropositivity was correlated with bacterial abundance in both neoplastic and matched normal tissue. While no association was found between H. pylori seropositivity and the presence of CRC, IgA seropositivity to CagA was associated with a decreased risk of advanced adenoma (odds ratio, OR = , % confidence intervals, CIs: -). Regarding IgG, higher antibody responses to HpaA was associated with advanced adenoma occurrence (OR = , % CI: -), while responses to HP0395, CagA and Catalase were associated with polyp development (OR = , %, CI: -, OR = , % CI: -, and OR = , CI: -, respectively). Positive correlations were found between H. pylori abundance in the normal mucosa and levels of both the IgA and IgG antibody response to Catalase and VacA antigens (r = , p < ; r = , p = ; r = , p < ; and r = , p = , respectively). Conversely, H. pylori abundance was negatively correlated with levels of IgA antibody response to HpaA and with IgG antibody response to HP0231 in the diseased tissue (r = -, p = and r = -, p = , respectively). The association between levels of H. pylori antigens and colorectal neoplasia risk gradually decreased with the adenoma progression, implicating the early activation of the immune response at the polyp stage. Thus, the evaluation of antibody response to certain bacterial antigens may indicate the presence of early-stage colorectal neoplasia. Further studies are needed to clarify the role H. pylori or the immune response to its antigens may have in colorectal carcinogenesis stages.']",antibody; antibodies; igg; seropositivity; caga; titer; antigens; serum; cancer; iga,antibody · antibodies · igg

BACKGROUND: Although antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Helicobacter pylori is a global threat to human health and the underlying molecular mechanisms have been explored previously, only a few of them are fully elucidated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, we isolated Helicobacter pylori strains from Southern China and assessed their susceptibility to five antibiotics using the agar dilution assay. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to screen the AMR genotypes of the Helicobacter pylori isolates. RESULTS: Our study revealed a high prevalence of resistance to clarithromycin (CLR), levofloxacin (LVX), and metronidazole (MTZ) in the Chinese isolates, % of which showed multidrug-resistant phenotypes. We screened for the types of previously reported AMR mutations in genes, but only a few of them were related to the AMR phenotype. Furthermore, we discovered four new mutations in the 23S rRNA gene and one mutation in infB related to CLR resistance. Another three mutations in gyrA and one in gyrB were closely correlated with the AMR pattern against LVX. We also demonstrated that the mutations R16C/H in rdxA, V56I in rpsU, and D54A in sodB might contribute to resistance to MTZ, which were previously reported in laboratory experiments but not found in clinical strains. We examined the concordance between the genotype and phenotype of AMR and identified several potential molecular biomarkers for predicting CLR and LVX resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our study explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the antibiotic resistance of Helicobacter pylori isolates from Southern China. We propose further epidemiologic investigations in China.', 'Helicobacter pylori Infections in the Bronx, New York: Surveying Antibiotic Susceptibility and Strain Lineage by Whole-Genome Sequencing.. The emergence of drug resistance in Helicobacter pylori has resulted in a greater need for susceptibility-guided treatment. While the alleles associated with resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin have been defined, there are limited data regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to other antimicrobials. Using H. pylori isolates from clinical specimens, we compared phenotypic and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based detection of resistance. Phenotypic resistance correlated with the presence of alleles of 23S rRNA (A2142G/A2143G) for clarithromycin (kappa coefficient, ; % confidence interval [CI], to ) and gyrA (N87I/N87K/D91Y/D91N/D91G/D99N) for levofloxacin (kappa coefficient, ; % CI, to ). Phenotypic resistance to amoxicillin in three isolates correlated with mutations in pbp1, pbp2, and/or pbp3 within coding regions near known amoxicillin binding motifs. All isolates were phenotypically susceptible to tetracycline, although four bore a mutation in 16S rRNA (A926G). For metronidazole, nonsense mutations and R16H substitutions in rdxA correlated with phenotypic resistance (kappa coefficient, ; % CI, to ). Previously identified mutations in the rpoB rifampin resistance-determining region (RRDR) were not present, but novel mutations outside the RRDR were found in rifampin-resistant isolates. WGS also allowed for strain lineage determination, which may be important for future studies in associating precise MICs with specific resistance alleles. In summary, WGS allows for broad analyses of H. pylori isolates, and our findings support the use of WGS for the detection of clarithromycin and levofloxacin resistance. Additional studies are warranted to better define mutations conferring resistance to amoxicillin, tetracycline, and rifampin, but combinatorial analyses for rdxA gene truncations and R16H mutations have utility for determining metronidazole resistance.', 'Genomic Analysis of Antimicrobial Resistance Genotype-to-Phenotype Agreement in Helicobacter pylori.. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Helicobacter pylori is increasing and can result in treatment failure and inappropriate antibiotic usage. This study used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to comprehensively analyze the H. pylori resistome and phylogeny in order to characterize Israeli H. pylori. Israeli H. pylori isolates (n = ) underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) against five antimicrobials and WGS analysis. Literature review identified mutations reported to correlate with phenotypic resistance to these antimicrobials. Analysis was conducted via our in-house bioinformatics pipeline targeting point mutations in the relevant genes (pbp1A, 23S rRNA, gyrA, rdxA, frxA, and rpoB) in order to assess genotype-to-phenotype correlation. Resistance rates of study isolates were as follows: clarithromycin %, metronidazole %, amoxicillin %, rifampicin %, and levofloxacin %. Genotype-to-phenotype correlation was inconsistent; for every analyzed gene at least one phenotypically susceptible isolate was found to have a mutation previously associated with resistance. This was also observed regarding mutations commonly used in commercial kits to diagnose AMR in H. pylori cases. Furthermore, novel point mutations associated with a resistant phenotype were detected. Analysis of a unique set of H. pylori isolates demonstrates that inferring resistance phenotypes from WGS in H. pylori remains challenging and should be optimized further.']",resistance; mutations; rdxa; isolates; strains; frxa; gyra; antibiotic; metronidazole; genes,resistance · mutations · rdxa

METHODS: A total of patients ( HIV-positive and HIV-negative) with gastrointestinal symptoms were examined by upper endoscopy and biopsy. Samples were assessed to determine the prevalence of H pylori infection, CMV, candida esophagitis and histologic chronic gastritis. RESULTS: The prevalence of H pylori was less common in HIV-positive patients (%) than in HIV-negative controls (%; P < ), and the prevalence of H pylori displayed a direct correlation with CD4 count stratification in HIV-positive patients.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived vesicles that play a critical role in host-pathogen interactions, facilitating intercellular communication and transporting both pathogen- and host-derived molecules during infection spread. To regulate their environment, for instance, by modulating innate and adaptive inflammatory immune responses, pathogens may alter the composition of EVs produced by infected cells. Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and Helicobacter pylori infection is considered a significant risk factor for its development. This cancer is characterized by significant inflammation mediated by EVs generated from infected host cells. H. pylori contributes substantially to inflammation, promoting disease progression. Moreover, H. pylori produces and releases vesicles known as outer membrane vesicles (H. pylori-OMVs), which contribute to the shrinkage and cellular transformation of the gastric epithelium. Although the vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) plays a critical role in pathogenesis, its association with EVs in H. pylori has not been previously addressed.

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a major risk factor for gastric cancer. Screening and treatment of H. pylori may reduce the risk of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of gastric biopsies provides superior sensitivity and specificity for the detection of H. pylori. This study explores whether population-based H. pylori screening with PCR is cost-effective in the US. METHODS: A Markov cohort state-transition model was developed to compare three strategies: no screening with opportunistic eradication, 13C-UBT population screening and treating of H. pylori, and PCR population screening and treating of H. pylori. Estimates of risks and costs were obtained from published literature. Since the efficacy of H. pylori therapy in gastric cancer prevention is not certain, we broadly varied the benefit -% in sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: PCR screening was cost-effective and had an incremental-cost effectiveness ratio per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) of $, when compared to 13C-UBT strategy with an ICER of $, per QALY. When compared to no screening, PCR population screening reduced cumulative gastric cancer incidence from % to % and reduced PUD risk from % to %. The cost-effectiveness of PCR screening was robust to most parameters in the model. CONCLUSIONS: Our modeling study finds PCR screening and treating of H. pylori to be cost-effective in the prevention of gastric cancer and PUD.

The uncertainty surrounding ICERs was addressed by scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: The ICER of serology screening versus no screening was $, per QALY gained ( percent confidence interval ( percent CI), $, to $,). The ICER of UBT versus no screening was $, per QALY gained ( percent CI, $, to $,). ICER of UBT versus serology screening was $, per QALY gained, for which almost all random samples of the ICERs distributed above $, per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: It cannot be confidently concluded that either H pylori screening was a cost-effective strategy compared with no screening in all Chinese at the age of years. Nevertheless, serology screening has demonstrated much more potential to be a cost-effective strategy, especially in the population with higher gastric cancer prevalence.']",screening; costeffectiveness; cost; costeffective; costs; strategy; qaly; cancer; incremental; per,screening · costeffectiveness · cost

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a harmful bacterium that is difficult to conveniently diagnose and effectively eradicate. Chronic H. pylori infection increases the risk of gastrointestinal diseases, even cancers. Despite the known findings, more underlying mechanisms are to be deeply explored to facilitate the development of novel prevention and treatment strategies of H. pylori infection. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNAs with more than nucleotides. They may be implicated in cell proliferation, inflammation and many other signaling pathways of gastrointestinal cancer progression. The dynamic expression of lncRNAs indicates their potential to be diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. In this paper, we comprehensively summarize the processes of H. pylori infection and the treatment methods, review the known findings of lncRNA classification and functional mechanisms, elucidate the roles of lncRNAs in H. pylori-related gastrointestinal cancer, and discuss the clinical perspectives of lncRNAs.', 'The correlation between lncRNAs and Helicobacter pylori in gastric cancer.. Helicobacter pylori infection performs a key role in gastric tumorigenesis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have demonstrated a great potential to be regarded as effective malignancy biomarkers for various gastrointestinal diseases including gastric cancer (GC). The present review highlights the relationship between lncRNAs and H. pylori in GC. Several studies have examined not only the involvement of lncRNAs in H. pylori-associated GC progression but also their molecular mechanisms of action. Among the pertinent studies, some have addressed the effects of H. pylori infection on modulatory networks of lncRNAs, while others have evaluated the effects of changes in the expression level of lncRNAs in H. pylori-associated gastric diseases, especially GC. The relationship between lncRNAs and H. pylori was found to be modulated by various molecular pathways.', 'Genome-wide analysis of long noncoding RNA profile in human gastric epithelial cell response to Helicobacter pylori.. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of pervasive genes, and their misregulation has been shown in various types of diseases. However, the relationship between lncRNAs and the immune response to pathogen infection has been rarely reported. Helicobacter pylori is a major human pathogenic bacterium that causes gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric cancer. The regulatory mechanism of the H. pylori-induced immune response is not yet clear. In the present study, we identified nonoverlapping signatures of a small number of lncRNAs that were aberrantly expressed in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells using microarray analysis followed by bioassays. From microarray data, we found that lncRNAs were upregulated and were downregulated. Five lncRNAs, XLOC_004562, XLOC_005912, XLOC_000620, XLOC_004122, and XLOC_014388, were further evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and the results matched well with microarray data. In addition, XLOC_004122 and XLOC_014388 were decreased in gastric mucosal tissues of H. pylori-positive patients. Differentially expressed lncRNAs may play a partial or key role in the immune response to H. pylori, and this may provide potential targets for the future treatment of H. pylori-related diseases.']",lncrnas; lncrna; noncoding; gc; rnas; rna; long; expression; mrnas; cancer,lncrnas · lncrna · noncoding

Despite evidence of enhanced yield with additional biopsies, combined Rapid Urease Tests (RUTs) have not been widely adopted. We aimed to compare the diagnostic efficacy of a combined antral and corpus rapid urease test (RUT) to a single antral RUT in a low prevalence cohort. METHODS: Between August and April adult patients undergoing a scheduled gastroscopy were prospectively recruited. At endoscopy biopsies were taken and processed for single and combined RUTs, histology and culture using standard techniques.

BACKGROUND: The rapid urease test (RUT) is used at Groote Schuur Hospital for diagnosing Helicobacter pylori infection. This is an in-house method, which has not been validated. OBJECTIVE: To validate our practice of reading the RUT immediately after endoscopy (RUT()), by comparing this with a reading at hours (RUT()) and with histological analysis. DESIGN: Ninety consecutive patients undergoing upper endoscopy over a -week period from October to November , and in whom rapid urease testing was indicated, were included in the study. Patients with recent exposure (within weeks of endoscopy) to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and antibiotics (confounders) were noted and included in the cohort. Two antral and two body biopsies were taken for histological examination and a third antral biopsy was placed in the RUT bottle. Both haematoxylin and eosin and modified Giemsa staining methods were used to identify H. pylori. The RUT was read immediately (within minutes of upper endoscopy) (RUT()), as per our current practice, and each specimen was re-read at hours (RUT()). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and the impact of confounders were calculated. RESULTS: Of the patients undergoing rapid urease testing, % were male and % were female, with a mean age of years (range - years). Histological examination revealed H. pylori in % (N=) of the biopsy specimens. In the patients without confounders, the sensitivity and specificity of the RUT() were % and % respectively, and % and % for RUT(). After including the patients with confounders, the sensitivity and specificity were % and % for RUT(), and % and % for RUT() respectively. Thirteen RUT() specimens (%) that were initially negative became positive at the RUT() reading. There were (%) RUT()- and RUT()-negative but histology-positive specimens. Four of these false-negative RUT() results could be accounted for by a low H. pylori density on histological analysis ( patients were taking PPIs). Confounders did not alter the sensitivity and specificity outcomes or impact on the number of false-negative RUTs. CONCLUSIONS: Our locally prepared RUT is a specific test for the detection of H. pylori infection. The sensitivity is greatly enhanced by reading the test at hours. The use of PPIs, H()RAs and antibiotics preceding endoscopy did not impact significantly on the results.']",rut; test; rapid; urease; tests; histology; sensitivity; culture; diagnostic; positive,rut · test · rapid

METHODS: Eighty-seven treatment-naïve children ( males; median age, years) with H. pylori infection from January to August were recruited in this study. The status of H. pylori infection was confirmed by culture or histology with the aid of urea rapid test or C- urea breathe test.

However, their efficacy in children is uncertain and there are few well-designed studies. Here, we evaluated the eradication rates of standard triple therapy, bismuth-based quadruple therapy and sequential therapy in children with H. pylori infection. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was conducted in children infected with H. pylori in West China Second Hospital. They were randomly assigned to -day standard triple therapy (omeprazole + amoxicillin + clarithromycin), -day bismuth quadruple therapy (bismuth + omeprazole + amoxicillin + clarithromycin) and -day sequential therapy (omeprazole + amoxicillin for days followed by omeprazole + clarithromycin + metronidazole for days). The eradication rate was assessed by a 13C-urea breath test to weeks after therapy completion. Symptom improvement and adverse events were compared among the groups.

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a crucial role in understanding disease pathogenesis, genetic mechanisms, guiding drug design, and other biochemical processes, thus, the identification of PPIs is of great importance. With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology, a large amount of PPIs sequence data has been accumulated. Researchers have designed many experimental methods to detect PPIs by using these sequence data, hence, the prediction of PPIs has become a research hotspot in proteomics. However, since traditional experimental methods are both time-consuming and costly, it is difficult to analyze and predict the massive amount of PPI data quickly and accurately. To address these issues, many computational systems employing machine learning knowledge were widely applied to PPIs prediction, thereby improving the overall recognition rate. In this paper, a novel and efficient computational technology is presented to implement a protein interaction prediction system using only protein sequence information. First, the Position-Specific Iterated Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (PSI-BLAST) was employed to generate a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) containing protein evolutionary information from the initial protein sequence. Second, we used a novel data processing feature representation scheme, MatFLDA, to extract the essential information of PSSM for protein sequences and obtained five training and five testing datasets by adopting a five-fold cross-validation method. Finally, the random fern (RFs) classifier was employed to infer the interactions among proteins, and a model called MatFLDA_RFs was developed. The proposed MatFLDA_RFs model achieved good prediction performance with % average accuracy on Yeast dataset and % average accuracy on H. pylori dataset, which effectively outperformed other existing computational methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is capable of yielding better prediction results of PPIs, which provides an effective tool for the detection of new PPIs and the in-depth study of proteomics. Finally, we also developed a web server for the proposed model to predict protein-protein interactions, which is freely accessible online at http://.:/webserver/MatFLDA_RFs.', 'Sequence-based prediction of protein-protein interactions using weighted sparse representation model combined with global encoding.. BACKGROUND: Proteins are the important molecules which participate in virtually every aspect of cellular function within an organism in pairs. Although high-throughput technologies have generated considerable protein-protein interactions (PPIs) data for various species, the processes of experimental methods are both time-consuming and expensive. In addition, they are usually associated with high rates of both false positive and false negative results. Accordingly, a number of computational approaches have been developed to effectively and accurately predict protein interactions. However, most of these methods typically perform worse when other biological data sources (e.g., protein structure information, protein domains, or gene neighborhoods information) are not available. Therefore, it is very urgent to develop effective computational methods for prediction of PPIs solely using protein sequence information. RESULTS: In this study, we present a novel computational model combining weighted sparse representation based classifier (WSRC) and global encoding (GE) of amino acid sequence. Two kinds of protein descriptors, composition and transition, are extracted for representing each protein sequence. On the basis of such a feature representation, novel weighted sparse representation based classifier is introduced to predict protein interaction class. When the proposed method was evaluated with the PPIs data of S. cerevisiae, Human and H. pylori, it achieved high prediction accuracies of , and % respectively. Extensive experiments were performed for cross-species PPIs prediction and the prediction accuracies were also very promising. CONCLUSIONS: To further evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we then compared its performance with the method based on support vector machine (SVM). The results show that the proposed method achieved a significant improvement. Thus, the proposed method is a very efficient method to predict PPIs and may be a useful supplementary tool for future proteomics studies.', ""Improved protein-protein interactions prediction via weighted sparse representation model combining continuous wavelet descriptor and PseAA composition.. BACKGROUND: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential to most biological processes. Since bioscience has entered into the era of genome and proteome, there is a growing demand for the knowledge about PPI network. High-throughput biological technologies can be used to identify new PPIs, but they are expensive, time-consuming, and tedious. Therefore, computational methods for predicting PPIs have an important role. For the past years, an increasing number of computational methods such as protein structure-based approaches have been proposed for predicting PPIs. The major limitation in principle of these methods lies in the prior information of the protein to infer PPIs. Therefore, it is of much significance to develop computational methods which only use the information of protein amino acids sequence. RESULTS: Here, we report a highly efficient approach for predicting PPIs. The main improvements come from the use of a novel protein sequence representation by combining continuous wavelet descriptor and Chou's pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), and from adopting weighted sparse representation based classifier (WSRC). This method, cross-validated on the PPIs datasets of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Human and H. pylori, achieves an excellent results with accuracies as high as %, % and % respectively, significantly better than previously proposed methods. Extensive experiments are performed to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. CONCLUSIONS: The outstanding results yield by our model that the proposed feature extraction method combing two kinds of descriptors have strong expression ability and are expected to provide comprehensive and effective information for machine learning-based classification models. In addition, the prediction performance in the comparison experiments shows the well cooperation between the combined feature and WSRC. Thus, the proposed method is a very efficient method to predict PPIs and may be a useful supplementary tool for future proteomics studies.""]",prediction; proteinprotein; machine; ppis; interactions; learning; proposed; feature; method; classifier,prediction · proteinprotein · machine

BACKGROUND: Although Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has long been associated with many extragastric diseases, its long-term effects on declining lung function and the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains controversial.

The HPA3 peptide is an analogue of the linear antimicrobial peptide, HP(-), isolated from the N-terminal region of the Helicobacter pylori ribosomal protein, able to interact with zwitterionic lipid membranes and generate pores. Herein we focused on the importance of the degree of unsaturation of lipid acyl chains on HPA3 peptide-membrane interactions. Electrophysiology experiments carried out in reconstituted lipid membranes formed from phosphatidylcholines with one (-palmitoyl--oleoyl-sn-glycero--phosphocholine - POPC) and two monounsaturated acyl chains (,-dioleoyl-sn-glycero--phosphocholine - DOPC) demonstrate that the lesser degree of the packing density of membrane lipids encountered in DOPC-based planar membranes greatly enhances the electric activity of pores created by the HPA3 peptide. Data derived from fluorescence spectroscopy experiments demonstrate that upon interaction with the bilayer, the HPA3 peptide translocates to the trans-side of the membrane. From the same experiments, we demonstrate that in the case of DOPC-based planar membranes, the net amount of HPA3 peptide which passes across the membrane and re-dissolves in the trans solution is almost % greater than POPC-based membranes. Such data further emphasize the modulatory role played by lipid acyl chain in determining antimicrobial peptides-lipids interactions, and demonstrate that small differences in unsaturation degree can impose a sizeable influence on HPA3 peptide activity.', 'Single-molecule investigation of the interactions between reconstituted planar lipid membranes and an analogue of the HP(2-20) antimicrobial peptide.. In this study, we employed electrophysiology experiments carried out at the single-molecule level to study the mechanism of action of the HPA3 peptide, an analogue of the linear antimicrobial peptide, HP(-), isolated from the N-terminal region of the Helicobacter pylori ribosomal protein. Amplitude analysis of currents fluctuations induced by HPA3 peptide at various potentials in zwitterionic lipid membranes reveal the existence of reproducible conductive states in the stochastic behavior of such events, which directly supports the existence of transmembrane pores induced the peptide. From our data recorded both at the single-pore and macroscopic levels, we propose that the HPA3 pore formation is electrophoretically facilitated by trans-negative transmembrane potentials, and HPA3 peptides translocate into the trans monolayers after forming the pores. We present evidence according to which the decrease in the membrane dipole potential of a reconstituted lipid membranes leads to an augmentation of the membrane activity of HPA3 peptides, and propose that a lower electric dipole field of the interfacial region of the membrane caused by phloretin facilitates the surface-bound HPA3 peptides to break free from one leaflet of the membrane, insert into the membrane and contribute to pore formation spanning the entire thickness of the membrane.', 'The membrane insertion of helical antimicrobial peptides from the N-terminus of Helicobacter pylori ribosomal protein L1.. The interaction of two helical antimicrobial peptides, HPA3 and HPA3P with planar supported lipid membranes was quantitatively analysed using two complementary optical biosensors. The peptides are analogues of Hp(-) derived from the N-terminus of Helicobacter pylori ribosomal protein L1 (RpL1). The binding of these two peptide analogues to zwitterionic dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and negatively charged membranes composed of DMPC/dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) (:) was determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and dual polarisation interferometry (DPI). Using SPR analysis, it was shown that the proline substitution in HPA3P resulted in much lower binding for both zwitterionic and anionic membranes than HPA3. Structural changes in the planar DMPC and DMPC/DMPG (:) bilayers induced by the binding of both Hp(-) analogues were then resolved in real-time with DPI. The overall process of peptide-induced changes in membrane structure was analysed by the real-time changes in bound peptide mass as a function of bilayer birefringence. The insertion of both HPA3 and HPA3P into the supported lipid bilayers resulted in a decrease in birefringence with increasing amounts of bound peptide which reflects a decrease in the order of the bilayer. The binding of HPA3 to each membrane was associated with a higher level of bound peptide and greater membrane lipid disordering and a faster and higher degree of insertion into the membrane than HPA3P. Furthermore, the binding of both HPA3 and HPA3P to negatively charged DMPC/DMPG bilayers also leads to a greater disruption of the lipid ordering. These results demonstrate the geometrical changes in the membrane upon peptide insertion and the extent of membrane structural changes can be obtained quantitatively. Moreover, monitoring the effect of peptides on a structurally characterised bilayer has provided further insight into the role of membrane structure changes in the molecular basis of peptide selectivity and activity and may assist in defining the mode of antimicrobial action.']",peptides; peptide; antimicrobial; against; activity; hpa3; membrane; antibacterial; the; that,peptides · peptide · antimicrobial

Helicobacter Pylori (H.pylori) interacts with gastric epithelial cells and stimulates it to produce MMP-13in vitro. OBJECTIVE: The relation between MMP- gene expression and clinicopathological characteristics of gastric cancer in the presence of H.pylori infection was investigated in fifty patients. METHODS: The level of MMP- gene expression was measured by quantitative Real-time PCR method and was evaluated between two groups of normal and carcinomatous tissues. RESULTS: The results showed % elevation of MMP- expression in tumor tissues. H.pylori infection did not have a significant effect on the expression of MMP-. There was a correlation between gene expression and tumor type (P value = ). In addition, there was a significant correlation between MMP- gene expression and tumor stage in intestinal group (P value = ). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, it might be concluded that in intestinal group, immune system plays an important role in reducing gene expression. Results also showed over expression (%) in diffuse group. These findings suggest that using MMP- inhibitors in diffuse group might contribute to the control of tumor growth.', 'Helicobacter pylori infection promotes the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer through increasing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-10.. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of Helicobacter pylori infection in the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer. Specimens from patients with gastric cancer (of which patients had metastatic gastric cancer) and patients with chronic gastritis were included in this study. H. pylori infection was determined by ELISA and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) and MMP- was observed using immunohistochemistry. The correlation between H. pylori infection and the clinical pathological features of gastric cancer was analyzed by SPSS software. The protein expression levels of MMP- and MMP- in MGC- cells infected with H. pylori were analyzed using western blotting. H. pylori infection was found in of the patients with gastric cancer and in of the patients with chronic gastritis. In addition, H. pylori infection was correlated with the staging and lymph node metastasis, but not with the gender, age and histological types of patients. H. pylori infection was also significantly correlated with the expression of MMP- and MMP- (r=, P< and r=, P<, respectively). The expression of MMP- and MMP- was significantly upregulated following induction by H. pylori infection (P<), with significant effects occurring following infection for and h, respectively. H. pylori infection may promote the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer by increasing the expression of MMP- and MMP-.', 'Correlation between expression of MMP-9 and MMP-3 in Helicobacter pylori infected patients with different gastroduodenal diseases.. BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of most important gastro-duodenal diseases, such as gastritis, peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and gastric cancer. H. pylori upregulates the expression and activity of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the gastric mucosa, but the role of MMP- and MMP- in infected patients with H. pylori have not been clearly defined yet. We examined mucosal MMP- and MMP- mRNA levels in gastric mucosa of H. pylori infected patients and evaluated the effects of virulence factors cagA and vacA allelic variants on these levels. We also determined correlation between mucosal MMP- and MMP- mRNA levels and types of disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from gastric biopsies of H. pylori-infected patients and H. pylori-negative patients. Mucosal MMP- and MMP- mRNA expression level in H. pylori-infected and non-infected gastric biopsies were determined by real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Presence of vacA (vacuolating cytotoxin A) and cagA (cytotoxin associated gene A) virulence factors were evaluated using PCR. RESULTS: The levels of MMP- in gastric mucosa were not different between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative patients. There was no correlation between MMP- mRNA expression and virulence factor (cagA and vacA allelic variants) and the different types of disease (gastritis and PUD) in infected patients. But MMP- mRNA expression was significantly higher in biopsies of H. pylori-infected patients compared to H. pylori-negative patients. Also mucosal MMP- mRNA expression in H. pylori-infected patients was significantly associated with cagA status PUD. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that MMP- might be involved in the pathogenesis of H. pylori. PUD could be associated with cag PAI-dependent MMP- upregulation.']",mmp; matrix; timp; mmps; expression; metalloproteinases; metalloproteinase; gastric; mt; mmp9,mmp · matrix · timp

The association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and pancreatic was suggested, but the issue remains of contentious. The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between H. pylori infection and pancreatic cancer development on a sample of Polish population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: patients with pancreatic cancer and controls were included in the study. Seropositivity for H. pylori, including CagA protein were assessed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot, respectively. The frequency of H. pylori in pancreatic cancer patients and controls were compared adjusted for age, sex, cigarette smoking and a family history of cancer in the logistic regresion model. RESULTS: No significant differences between pancreatic cancer patients and controls were seen according to H. pylori seropositivity ( vs %; OR = ; CI95%: -; p = ) and CagA seropositivity ( vs %; OR = ; CI95%: -; p = ).

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori has been suggested to be involved in pancreatic diseases, namely autoimmune pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma. We investigated the presence of conserved sequences of Helicobacter in pancreatic tissue and pancreatic juice from patients with chronic nonautoimmune and autoimmune pancreatitis as well as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS: pancreatic juices collected during routine endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and pancreatic tissues were studied. Nested PCR was used to detect H. pylori in the isolated DNA samples. In order to exclude a methodological bias, the samples were analyzed blindly in different laboratories using either conventional or LightCycler PCR for H. pylori urease A and 16S ribosomal DNA. RESULTS: In the pancreas of patients with autoimmune pancreatitis, no H. pylori DNA could be detected. Further, in none of the other tissue samples of chronic pancreatitis or PDAC could we detect any Helicobacter sequences. Out of the pancreatic juice samples, none demonstrated either of the Helicobacter gene sequences investigated. CONCLUSION: Despite good scientific reasoning for an involvement of Helicobacter in pancreatic diseases, a direct infection of the microbial agent seems unlikely. Rather, the pathomechanism must involve molecular mimicry in autoimmune pancreatitis, or the transformation of nitric food constituents to nitrosamines in pancreatic cancer. and IAP.', 'Epidemiology of pancreatic cancer: an update.. Pancreatic cancer, although infrequent, has a very poor prognosis, making it one of the or most common causes of cancer mortality in developed countries. Its incidence varies greatly across regions, which suggests that lifestyle factors such as diet, and environmental factors, such as vitamin D exposure, play a role. Because pancreatic cancer is strongly age-dependent, increasing population longevity and ageing will lead to an increase of the global burden of pancreatic cancer in the coming decades. Smoking is the most common known risk factor, causing -% of all pancreatic tumors. Although a common cause of pancreatitis, heavy alcohol intake is associated only with a modest increased risk of pancreatic cancer. While viruses do not represent a major risk factor, people infected with Helicobacter pylori appeared to be at high risk of pancreatic cancer. Many factors associated with the metabolic syndrome, including overweight and obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and long-standing diabetes also increase the risk disease, while atopic allergy and use of metformin as a treatment for diabetes have been associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer. A family history of pancreatic cancer is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer and it is estimated that -% of patients with pancreatic cancer have an underlying germline disorder. Having a non-O blood group, another inherited characteristic, has also been steadily associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.

BACKGROUND: Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is a common digestive disease. Without active treatment, it may induce gastric cancer. Western medicine has a certain effect on chronic atrophic gastritis, but there are many adverse reactions after long-term medication, and the disease is prone to relapse after treatment, which will affect the health and life of patients. Traditional Chinese medicine has obvious advantages in the treatment of chronic stomach diseases with reliable effect. A number of clinical data have also confirmed that Banxia Xiexin decoction has significant effect in the treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis, but there is no evidence of evidence-based medicine. Therefore, this study aims to explore the clinical efficacy and safety of Banxia Xiexin decoction in the treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis by means of systematic evaluation. METHOD: Databases including PubMed, The Cochrance Library, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang were searched by computer. Besides, Baidu Scholar and Google Scholar were manually searched, and all randomized controlled trials of Banxia xiexin decoction for the treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis were collected. The retrieval time was from the establishment of the database to July , . After reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted the data and evaluated the bias risk of the included study, RevMan5. software (developed by the UK's International Cochrane Collaboration) was used to analyze the data.

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is the only bacterium in the stomach. It is characterized by its ability to adhere to gastric mucosa and cause a series of pathological changes in the gastric mucosa. Modern research shows that Hp is an important pathogenic factor for chronic gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcer, and gastric cancer.

Gastric cancer is the second most common fatal malignancy in the world. Its incidence is high in East Asia. Helicobacter pylori infection is an important factor in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. Epidemiological studies have established a strong causal relationship between H. pylori infection and gastric cancer. H. pylori eradication is therefore likely to be one of the most promising approaches to gastric cancer prevention. Animal studies have shown that eradication of H. pylori infection, especially at the early stage, is effective in preventing H. pylori-related gastric carcinogenesis. However, the available data from human studies show that H. pylori eradication does not completely prevent gastric cancer and that it might be useful only in patients without atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia at baseline. Longer follow-up and additional studies are needed to clarify this issue.', 'Treatment of Helicobacter pylori and prevention of gastric cancer.. Gastric cancer is the second commonest fatal malignancy in the world with a high incidence in China. Helicobacter pylori infection is an important factor in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. Epidemiological studies have shown a strong causal relationship between H. pylori infection and gastric cancer. Animal studies also show that eradication of H. pylori infection, especially at the early stage, is effective in preventing H. pylori-related gastric carcinogenesis. H. pylori eradication leads to regression and prevents the progression of gastric precancerous lesions, but only in a minority of cases. H. pylori eradication appears to be the most promising approach in gastric cancer prevention. The current available data in human studies showed that H. pylori eradication can reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer and this strategy is more useful in patients without atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a major risk factor for gastric cancer (GC) development, which is one of the most challenging malignant diseases worldwide with limited treatments. In the multistep pathogenesis of GC, H. pylori infection slowly induces chronic active gastritis, which progresses through the premalignant stages of atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia, and then finally to GC. Although eradication of H. pylori is a reasonable approach for the prevention of GC, there have been some contradictory reports, with only some long-term follow-up data showing efficacy of this approach. The inconsistencies are likely due to the insufficient number of participants, relatively short follow-up periods, poor quality of study designs, and the degree and extent of preneoplastic changes at the time of H. pylori eradication. This review analyzes recent high-quality studies to resolve the discrepancies regarding the eradication of H. pylori for GC prevention. The relationship between H. pylori eradication and GC/precancerous lesions/metachronous GC is examined, and the cost-effectiveness of this strategy in the prevention of GC is assessed. Although it is assumed that eradication of H. pylori has the potential to prevent GC, the feasibility and appropriate timing of this strategy for cancer prevention remain to be determined.

Helicobacter pylori is a well-known human-specific stomach pathogen that infects more than half of the world's population. The infection with this bacterium can cause a variety of gastrointestinal problems, including chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and even cancer. H. pylori is a highly infectious bacterium. H. pylori causes an increase in gastric mucosa pH or gastric mucosa intestinal metaplasia. These modifications in the stomach environment are necessary for G. lamblia colonization to occur. Giardia lamblia is a flagellate protozoan parasite that can cause giardiasis in humans and other mammals. It dwells in the duodenum and upper jejunum. Globally, over million cases of human giardiasis are predicted to occur each year. Simultaneous human colonization by G. lamblia and H. pylori is a typical occurrence since the viruses' predisposing factors are similar in both groups. Giardiasis is a parasitic infection that affects both children and adults worldwide. Infection with Giardia is more common in underdeveloped countries. Globally, more than million cases of giardiasis are detected each year. In contrast, the presence of G. lamblia in the host body triggers an immunological response comparable to that of H. pylori, with lymphocytes strongly polarized towards Th1. As a result, their combined presence exacerbates host tissue damage. The major goal of this seminar is to describe the pathophysiology, immunology, and clinical aspects of G. lamblia and H. pylori coinfection using a comprehensive search of PubMed, Lancet, and Google Scholar sources. Upper gastrointestinal problems such as upper abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain/burning, and belching are all caused by both organisms. Differentiation by physical examination is impossible in people infected with both bacteria. For this coinfection distinction, a laboratory diagnosis is required. G. lamblia and H. pylori, when present together, have a synergistic effect on the host and can cause serious damage. As a result, researchers should delve deeper into the mechanics underlying this potential microbial interaction.""]",parasites; giardia; lamblia; giardiasis; coinfection; intestinal; intestinalis; fmf; children; entamoeba,parasites · giardia · lamblia

BACKGROUND: The role of special stains in the detection of H. pylori is controversial; some pathologists claim that hematoxylin and eosin staining alone is adequate to detect bacteria, while others maintain that immunohistochemical staining must be used on all gastric biopsies. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that hematoxylin and eosin and histochemical special stains have similar sensitivity and that immunohistochemical staining only marginally enhances the detection rate of the organisms.

BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has been extensively implicated in the etiology and pathogenesis of gastric ulcers and carcinomas, which has necessitated its efficient and cost-effective identification in gastric biopsy samples. We have sought to compare various staining methods, namely, Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Giemsa, and Modified Toluidine Blue (MTB), with immunohistochemistry (IHC; gold standard) in terms of efficacy, staining costs, and duration of performing the stains in settings with limited resources. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Gastric biopsy specimens of patients who presented with gastritis symptoms were stained with H&E, Giemsa, MTB, and IHC. The sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values, and the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated for each stain. RESULTS: In all, cases of were positive for H. pylori on IHC. The specificity for both H&E and Giemsa was %, whereas it was lower for MTB (%). The sensitivity of H&E was much lower (%) compared with the other stains (% Giemsa, % MTB). The most inexpensive and time-consuming stain was H&E followed by MTB and Giemsa. CONCLUSION: When H&E is used alone for H. pylori detection, a significant number of cases may be overlooked, especially mild inflammatory cases and when coccoid forms of the bacteria are present. This study proposes the use of either Giemsa or MTB as reliable alternatives for IHC in resource-limited settings to combat the high prevalence of H. pylori in the developing world.']",stain; staining; giemsa; ihc; stains; biopsies; he; biopsy; blue; detection,stain · staining · giemsa

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection constitutes a major pathogenic factor in gastric carcinogenesis and is extensively involved in tumor development, progression, and the modulation of the immune microenvironment. In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown remarkable advancements in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, their efficacy varies markedly between patients. Emerging evidence indicates that the H. pylori infection status may profoundly affect treatment efficacy. Research has demonstrated that H. pylori regulates the PD-/PD-L1 axis and anti-tumor immune responses through virulence factors (e.g., CagA and VacA) and alterations in the immune microenvironment. Additionally, infection-associated dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and suppression of T cell function are implicated in diminished ICI efficacy. Clinical data show that H. pylori-positive patients have markedly reduced overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with their negative counterparts after ICI therapy.This review summarizes recent advances in H. pylori infection and GC immunotherapy, and the underlying mechanisms, focusing on how H. pylori shapes the tumor immune landscape to impair ICI efficacy. Key molecular pathways, inflammatory cascades, and microbial interactions were also discussed. We evaluated the clinical utility of H. pylori status as a predictive biomarker, and explored combinatorial therapeutic strategies for infected patients. A deeper understanding of H. pylori-driven mechanisms and the development of precision medicine approaches hold promise for enhancing immunotherapy outcomes and offering novel therapeutic avenues for patients with GC.', 'Overcoming immunotherapy resistance in gastric cancer: insights into mechanisms and emerging strategies.. Gastric cancer (GC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with limited treatment options in advanced stages. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD1/PD-L1, has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach. However, a significant proportion of patients exhibit primary or acquired resistance, limiting the overall efficacy of immunotherapy. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms underlying immunotherapy resistance in GC, including the role of the tumor immune microenvironment, dynamic PD-L1 expression, compensatory activation of other immune checkpoints, and tumor genomic instability. Furthermore, the review explores GC-specific factors such as molecular subtypes, unique immune evasion mechanisms, and the impact of Helicobacter pylori infection. We also discuss emerging strategies to overcome resistance, including combination therapies, novel immunotherapeutic approaches, and personalized treatment strategies based on tumor genomics and the immune microenvironment. By highlighting these key areas, this review aims to inform future research directions and clinical practice, ultimately improving outcomes for GC patients undergoing immunotherapy.', 'Effect of Helicobacter pylori on immunotherapy is gaining more attention.. BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors, has been widely used in tumor therapy and have shown ideal clinical efficacy. However, some cancers still do not respond to PD-/PD-L1 blockade therapy effectively. Helicobacter pylori infection might affect the curative effect of immunotherapy while it is rarely reported. We aimed to visualize the research hotspots and trends of H. pylori and immunotherapy using a bibliometric analysis to help understand the future development of basic and clinical research. METHODS: The relevant publications on H. pylori and immunotherapy were searched on April , , in the Web of Science Core Collection Database (WOSCC). The document types were limited to articles and reviews. The VOSviewer . software was used to assess the co-authorship, co-occurrence, citation of countries, institutions, authors, journals, and hotspot keywords. The research status and trend change of H. pylori and immunotherapy were analyzed by bibliometric analysis. RESULTS: A total of studies authored by researchers were eventually included in this study. The majority of the retrieved studies were (%) original research articles. China conducted the greatest number of studies, followed by USA and Italy. The related topics included the following three aspects: the relationship between microorganisms and cancer, the relationship between gastric cancer and immunity, and the relationship between H. pylori and immunotherapy, including purified/cloned components of H. pylori acting as efficient adjuvant to boost tumor responses and H. pylori infection which modulate host immune responses and impact on the efficacy of antitumor immunity initiated by immune checkpoint inhibitors. The timing diagram revealed that the current research hotspots focused on effects of microorganisms on immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: The effect of H. pylori on cancer immunotherapy is getting more and more attention in these years. It still remains uncertain, and more studies are needed in the future.']",immunotherapy; pdl1; immune; checkpoint; survival; gc; tumor; cancer; ici; pd,immunotherapy · pdl1 · immune

Helicobacter pylori is the only major infection for which antimicrobial therapy is not designed using the principles of antimicrobial stewardship. Traditionally, antimicrobial therapy is a susceptibility-based therapy, achieves high cure rates, and includes surveillance programs to regularly provide updated data regarding resistance, outcomes, and treatment guidelines. Current H. pylori therapies identified by trial-and-error, and treatment recommendations and guidelines are based on comparisons among regimens that rarely take into account the prevalence or effect of resistance. The majority of patients currently treated achieve suboptimal results. A paradigm shift is required to abandon current approaches and embrace antimicrobial stewardship, and therefore reliably achieve high cure rates; develop, propagate, and update best practice guidelines; and provide surveillance of local or regional susceptibility/resistance patterns. These also require timely updates to clinicians regarding the current status of resistance, antimicrobial effectiveness, and ways to prevent antimicrobial misuse to extend the useful life of currently available antibiotics. Here, we discuss the differences among current approaches to H. pylori therapy and antimicrobial stewardship and identify what is required to achieve the transition. Conceptually, the differences are significant, and the transition will likely need to be both abrupt and complete. Recommendations for therapy during the transition period are given.', 'Culture-based antibiotic susceptibility testing for Helicobacter pylori infection: a systematic review.. BACKGROUND: Primary antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) strains is increasing worldwide, affecting therapy success. The use of therapies tailored on susceptibility pre-testing at culture has been proposed, but data are still conflicting. METHOD: We performed a systematic review to evaluate the role of a culture-based therapeutic approach for H. pylori treatment, taking into account the sensitivity of culture and the success rates achieved with tailored therapies in different therapeutic steps. RESULTS: We analyzed data from studies. Overall, H. pylori strains were isolated in % of patients, the success rates being %, %, % and %, before first-, second-, third-line or more therapies, respectively. In comparative studies, the infection was cured in % of patients treated with tailored therapies, and in % of patients receiving empiric therapy (P<). However, in the subanalysis, the tailored approach achieved optimal eradication rates (>%) only when it was applied before first- and second-line therapies, but not before third-line or more attempts (<%). Moreover, no significant difference emerged between the approaches when data from only the most recent (last years) studies were considered, as well as in those performed in Western populations. CONCLUSIONS: The attempt to achieve antibiotic susceptibility testing before treatment failed in % of infected patients managed in dedicated laboratories. Culture-tailored therapies administered after or more therapies achieved suboptimal eradication rates. The role of bacterial culture in patients whose therapeutic management failed to eradicate H. pylori probably needs to be corroborated by further data.', 'Best Practices for Helicobacter pylori Management.. For decades, antimicrobial therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection has been given empirically, and the results of therapy (success or failure) have either not been confirmed or when confirmed have not been used to modify prescribing behavior. These practices coupled with increasing antibiotic resistance have resulted in low cure rates overall. Susceptibility testing for H pylori has increasingly become available, especially in the United States. Availability of susceptibility-based therapy has encouraged adoption of the principles of antimicrobial stewardship for H pylori infection (eg, limiting antibiotic choice to antibiotics for which the infection is susceptible given at optimal doses, formulations, frequency of administration, and duration). Antimicrobial regimens can now be classified as empiric therapies, susceptibility-based therapies, potentially effective therapies requiring optimization, and therapies containing unneeded antibiotics that should not be used. This article describes current best practices and recommendations for integrating culture-based and molecular-based susceptibility testing into H pylori therapy.']",resistance; antibiotic; testing; susceptibility; antimicrobial; treatment; therapy; therapies; failure; ast,resistance · antibiotic · testing

A PubMed and Google Scholar search was performed using the terms ""rosacea"", ""H.pylori"", ""gastrointestinal disorders and H.pylori"", ""microorganisms and rosacea"", ""pathogenesis and treatment of rosacea"", and ""risk factors of rosacea"", and selected publications were studied and referenced in text. Although a possible pathogenetic link between H. pylori and rosacea is advocated by many authors, evidence is still interpreted differently by others. We conclude that further studies are needed in order to fully elucidate the pathogenesis of rosacea.', 'Relationship between Helicobacter pylori and Rosacea: review and discussion.. BACKGROUND: Rosacea is an inflammatory disease affecting the central part of face characterized by persistent or recurrent episodes of erythema, papules, pustules and telangiectasias of unknown etiology. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative bacillus, which is one of the main causes of chronic gastritis, gastric cancer and gastrointestinal ulcers. Recent evidences have suggested that H. pylori infection is closely related to the occurrence of diseases. In recent years, studies have found that Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with the occurrence of acne rosacea. So the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection may be a therapeutic method of acne rosacea. But it continues to be controversial. In other studies, the treatment of Helicobacter pylori did not significantly reduce the severity of acne rosacea. To further explore the association between acne rosacea and Helicobacter pylori infection, a summarize method was used to study the relationship between acne rosacea and Helicobacter pylori, providing reference for clinical acne rosacea therapy. METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted on Wanfang Data, CQVIP, Springer, Public Health Management Corporation (PHMC), CNKI, and Pubmed, from January , to Mar. , , using Helicobacter pylori and rosacea to retrieve the literature. Depending on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, articles considered or confirmed the correlation between H. pylori and rosacea. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations and experiments have confirmed that H. pylori infection is associated with the development of rosacea. The effect of anti-H. pylori therapy is better than the routine therapy for rosacea. H. pylori can stimulate the immune system to produce a large number of inflammatory mediators, leading to the occurrence and aggravation of rosacea inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: It is confirmed that H. pylori infection is involved in the development of rosacea. It is suggested that rosacea patients should be tested for H. pylori infection, the H. pylori-positive rosacea patients should be treated with eradication of H. pylori, so as to enhance the therapeutic effect of rosacea. This study adds that H. pylori infection is involved in the development of rosacea. Epidemiological investigations and experiments have confirmed the rationality. The effect of anti-H. pylori therapy is better than the routine therapy for rosacea.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Helicobacter pylori toxin vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) promotes gastric colonization, and its presence (VacA(+)) is associated with more-severe disease. The exact mechanisms by which VacA contributes to infection are unclear. We previously found that limited exposure to VacA induces autophagy of gastric cells, which eliminates the toxin; we investigated whether autophagy serves as a defense mechanism against H pylori infection. METHODS: We investigated the effect of VacA on autophagy in human gastric epithelial cells and primary gastric cells from mice. Expression of p62, a marker of autophagy, was also assessed in gastric tissues from patients infected with toxigenic (VacA(+)) or nontoxigenic strains. We analyzed the effect of VacA on autophagy in peripheral blood monocytes obtained from subjects with different genotypes of ATG16L1, which regulates autophagy. We performed genotyping for ATG16L1 in cohorts of infected and uninfected subjects. RESULTS: Prolonged exposure of human gastric epithelial cells and mouse gastric cells to VacA disrupted induction of autophagy in response to the toxin, because the cells lacked cathepsin D in autophagosomes. Loss of autophagy resulted in the accumulation of p62 and reactive oxygen species. Gastric biopsy samples from patients infected with VacA(+), but not nontoxigenic strains of H pylori, had increased levels of p62. Peripheral blood monocytes isolated from individuals with polymorphisms in ATG16L1 that increase susceptibility to Crohn's disease had reduced induction of autophagy in response to VacA(+) compared to cells from individuals that did not have these polymorphisms. The presence of the ATG16L1 Crohn's disease risk variant increased susceptibility to H pylori infection in separate cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Autophagy protects against infection with H pylori; the toxin VacA disrupts autophagy to promote infection, which could contribute to inflammation and eventual carcinogenesis."", '[Impact of Helicobacter pylori infection on autophagy of different cells--a review].. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative pathogen that widely colonizes in the human gastric mucosa, and is associated with various gastric diseases. Recently, much attention has been aroused on the relationship between H. pylori infection and autophagy. Accumulating evidence suggests that H. pylori can induce autophagy in gastric epithelial cells and professional phagocytes. Both the virulent factors of H. pylori and host autophagic proteins have been demonstrated to affect H. pylori-induced autophagy. Besides, the process of autophagy plays an important role in determining the intracellular fate of H. pylori. Here, we review the impact of H. pylori infection on autophagy of different cells.', 'Molecular mechanism of Helicobacter pylori-induced autophagy in gastric cancer.. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative pathogen that colonizes gastric epithelial cells. The drug resistance rates of H. pylori have dramatically increased, causing persistent infections. Chronic infection by H. pylori is a critical cause of gastritis, peptic ulcers and even gastric cancer. In host cells, autophagy is stimulated to maintain cellular homeostasis following intracellular pathogen recognition by the innate immune defense system. However, H. pylori-induced autophagy is not consistent during acute and chronic infection. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the association between H. pylori infection and autophagy in gastric epithelial cells could aid the understanding of the mechanisms of persistent infection and the identification of autophagy-associated therapeutic targets for H. pylori infection. The present review describes the role of H. pylori and associated virulence factors in the induction of autophagy by different signaling pathways during acute infection. Additionally, the inhibition of autophagy in gastric epithelial cells during chronic infection was discussed. The present review summarized H. pylori-mediated autophagy and provided insights into its mechanism of action, suggesting the induction of autophagy as a novel therapeutic target for persistent H. pylori infection.']",autophagy; cells; autophagic; intracellular; vaca; lysosomal; apoptosis; atg16l1; that; gastric,autophagy · cells · autophagic

Blue light is commonly used to kill Propionibacterium acnes in clinic. Furthermore, blue light exhibits a good bactericidal effect against Helicobacter pylori, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and many oral bacteria in laboratory studies. The bactericidal mechanism of blue light as commonly accepted consists photo-excitation of intracellular porphyrins resulting in production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species which can inactivate bacteria. Blue light can kill bacteria without additional exogenous photosensitizers. In addition, it produces little harm to mammalian cells. Therefore, as the increasing emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms, blue light might be a good antibacterial tool.', 'In vitro photodynamic antimicrobial activity of methylene blue and endoscopic white light against Helicobacter pylori 26695.. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a method for inactivating cells (viral, bacterial and cancer cells) using photosensitizers (PS) and light of various wavelengths. Helicobacter pylori might be easily affected by light because it has few genes to repair light-induced DNA damage. In vitro PDT against H. pylori was conducted using endoscopic white light and methylene blue (MB) as the PS before application to in vivo study. The bactericidal effects were measured by counting viable cells after PDT. The degree of oxidative damage of DNA was confirmed using alkaline gel electrophoresis, real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and an assay of -hydroxy--deoxyguanosine (-OHdG). In the control group, the number of viable cells was maintained constantly during the experiment. In the groups treated with either 2mg/mlMB alone or white light with 02mg/mlMB for 10min, bacteria decreased approximately a hundredfold. The killing effect increased proportionally to the PS concentration and the duration of irradiation. DNA damage by PDT proven by alkaline gel electrophoresis, RT-PCR and assay of -OHdG, was greater in PDT-treated groups than in control. PDT using MB and endoscopic white light showed effective bactericidal activity in vitro by oxidative DNA damage of H. pylori.', 'Blue light for infectious diseases: Propionibacterium acnes, Helicobacter pylori, and beyond?. Blue light, particularly in the wavelength range of - nm, has attracted increasing attention due to its intrinsic antimicrobial effect without the addition of exogenous photosensitizers. In addition, it is commonly accepted that blue light is much less detrimental to mammalian cells than ultraviolet irradiation, which is another light-based antimicrobial approach being investigated. In this review, we discussed the blue light sensing systems in microbial cells, antimicrobial efficacy of blue light, the mechanism of antimicrobial effect of blue light, the effects of blue light on mammalian cells, and the effects of blue light on wound healing. It has been reported that blue light can regulate multi-cellular behavior involving cell-to-cell communication via blue light receptors in bacteria, and inhibit biofilm formation and subsequently potentiate light inactivation. At higher radiant exposures, blue light exhibits a broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Blue light therapy is a clinically accepted approach for Propionibacterium acnes infections. Clinical trials have also been conducted to investigate the use of blue light for Helicobacter pylori stomach infections and have shown promising results. Studies on blue light inactivation of important wound pathogenic bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have also been reported. The mechanism of blue light inactivation of P. acnes, H. pylori, and some oral bacteria is proved to be the photo-excitation of intracellular porphyrins and the subsequent production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. Although it may be the case that the mechanism of blue light inactivation of wound pathogens (e.g., S. aureus, P. aeruginosa) is the same as that of P. acnes, this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. Limited and discordant results have been reported regarding the effects of blue light on mammalian cells and wound healing. Under certain wavelengths and radiant exposures, blue light may cause cell dysfunction by the photo-excitation of blue light sensitizing chromophores, including flavins and cytochromes, within mitochondria or/and peroxisomes. Further studies should be performed to optimize the optical parameters (e.g., wavelength, radiant exposure) to ensure effective and safe blue light therapies for infectious disease. In addition, studies are also needed to verify the lack of development of microbial resistance to blue light.']",light; blue; pdt; photodynamic; irradiation; mb; apdt; porphyrins; photosensitizer; phototherapy,light · blue · pdt

Enterohepatic Helicobacter species have been hypothesized to play a role in different disorders, including hepatocellular carcinoma, gallstones formation and cholangiocellular carcinoma, as well as enteric diseases and inflammatory bowel diseases. Concerning the extragastric manifestations of H. pylori infection, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and sideropenic anemia represent, based on the current data, the diseases in which the pathogenic link appears to be strongest.

Since the discovery of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), numerous studies have considered the possibility that it plays a role in different extragastric diseases. Most of these studies may be classified as epidemiological studies or investigations of H. pylori eradication, but there are also case reports and in vitro studies. This review reveals the limitations common to most of them. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is the disease for which the strongest association with H. pylori infection has been shown. Data are also accumulating about the role of H. pylori infection in idiopathic iron deficiency anemia and chronic idiopathic urticaria. Interesting results show that H. pylori infection affects atherosclerosis and is weakly associated with ischemic heart disease and stroke. Moreover, CagA-positive H. pylori strains may play a role in the natural history of atherosclerotic stroke. Recent studies suggest a link between H. pylori and Parkinson's disease. Preliminary data indicate that H. pylori infection impairs gastric ghrelin production and may influence nutritional status. The association between H. pylori infection and other extragastric diseases remains controversial. H. pylori infection may cause extragastric manifestations directly or indirectly, by various mechanisms including atrophic gastritis, the release of inflammatory mediators, molecular mimicry, and systemic immune response. Evidence suggests that anti-H. pylori therapy improves idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (significant increase of platelet count in half of the cases), iron-deficiency anemia, and chronic urticaria (% remission rate), but the data from randomized controlled trials are insufficient to confirm these positive effects."", 'Review: Helicobacter pylori and extragastric diseases..

Binding of the DnaA protein to oriC leads to DNA melting within the DNA unwinding element (DUE) and initiates replication of the bacterial chromosome. Helicobacter pylori oriC was previously identified as a region localized upstream of dnaA and containing a cluster of DnaA boxes bound by DnaA protein with a high affinity. However, no unwinding within the oriC sequence has been detected. Comprehensive in silico analysis presented in this work allowed us to identify an additional region (oriC2), separated from the original one (oriC1) by the dnaA gene. DnaA specifically binds both regions, but DnaA-dependent DNA unwinding occurs only within oriC2. Surprisingly, oriC2 is bound exclusively as supercoiled DNA, which directly shows the importance of the DNA topology in DnaA-oriC interactions, similarly as previously presented only for initiator-origin interactions in Archaea and some Eukaryota. We conclude that H. pylori oriC exhibits bipartite structure, being the first such origin discovered in a Gram-negative bacterium. The H. pylori mode of initiator-oriC interactions, with the loop formation between the subcomplexes of the discontinuous origin, resembles those discovered in Bacillus subtilis chromosome and in many plasmids, which might suggest a similar way of controlling initiation of replication.', ""Structure and Function of the Campylobacter jejuni Chromosome Replication Origin.. Campylobacter jejuni is the leading bacterial cause of foodborne infections worldwide. However, our understanding of its cell cycle is poor. We identified the probable C. jejuni origin of replication (oriC) - a key element for initiation of chromosome replication, which is also important for chromosome structure, maintenance and dynamics. The herein characterized C. jejuni oriC is monopartite and contains (i) the DnaA box cluster, (ii) the DnaA-dependent DNA unwinding element (DUE) and (iii) binding sites for regulatory proteins. The cluster of five DnaA boxes and the DUE were found in the dnaA-dnaN intergenic region. Binding of DnaA to this cluster of DnaA-boxes enabled unwinding of the DUE in vitro. However, it was not sufficient to sustain replication of minichromosomes, unless the cluster was extended by additional DnaA boxes located in the ' end of dnaA. This suggests, that C. jejuni oriC requires these boxes to initiate or to regulate replication of its chromosome. However, further detailed mutagenesis is required to confirm the role of these two boxes in initiation of C. jejuni chromosome replication and thus to confirm partial localization of C. jejuni oriC within a coding region, which has not been reported thus far for any bacterial oriC. In vitro DUE unwinding by DnaA was inhibited by Cj1509, an orphan response regulator and a homolog of HP1021, that has been previously shown to inhibit replication in Helicobacter pylori. Thus, Cj1509 might play a similar role as a regulator of C. jejuni chromosome replication.

The main roles of the DnaA protein are to bind the origin of chromosome replication (oriC), to unwind DNA and to provide a hub for the step-wise assembly of a replisome. DnaA is composed of four domains, with each playing a distinct functional role in the orisome assembly. Out of the four domains, the role of domain I is the least understood and appears to be the most species-specific. To better characterise Helicobacter pylori DnaA domain I, we have constructed a series of DnaA variants and studied their interactions with H. pylori bipartite oriC. We show that domain I is responsible for the stabilisation and organisation of DnaA-oriC complexes and provides cooperativity in DnaA-DNA interactions. Domain I mediates cross-interactions between oriC subcomplexes, which indicates that domain I is important for long-distance DnaA interactions and is essential for orisosme assembly on bipartite origins. HobA, which interacts with domain I, increases the DnaA binding to bipartite oriC; however, it does not stimulate but rather inhibits DNA unwinding. This suggests that HobA helps DnaA to bind oriC, but an unknown factor triggers DNA unwinding. Together, our results indicate that domain I self-interaction is important for the DnaA assembly on bipartite H. pylori oriC.']",dnaa; replication; helicase; dna; oric; chromosome; binding; domain; hoba; hpdnab,dnaa · replication · helicase

To our knowledge, this is the first Korean case of presymptomatic detection of CDH1 mutation, and it highlights the importance of genetic screening for individuals with a family history of GC, especially in high-risk geographical areas.', 'Genetic analysis of a case of Helicobacter pylori-uninfected intramucosal gastric cancer in a family with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.. Germline mutations in CDH1, encoding E-cadherin, are known to be the causative mechanism of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). We encountered two cases of gastric cancer in a Japanese family with HDGC. A -year-old man (Case ) died of advanced gastric cancer. His younger sister aged (Case ) was diagnosed with intramucosal signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC). Both had identical germline CDH1 mutations, but Case was positive for Helicobacter pylori infection, whereas Case was negative. Case underwent total gastrectomy. Whole-exome sequencing of an intramucosal SRCC in Case revealed seven somatic mutations including one in CDH1. The six non-CDH1 mutations were classified as non-driver mutations. Decreased expression of E-cadherin in intramucosal SRCC was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Our report demonstrated that CDH1 mutation was the only active driver mutation in Helicobacter pylori-uninfected intramucosal SRCC.']",cancer; gc; mutations; gastric; genetic; cdh1; germline; hereditary; tp53; molecular,cancer · mutations · gastric

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a major etiological factor of peptic ulcer disease (PUD). It is supposed to be a risk factor for the more frequently encountered PUD in patients with liver cirrhosis. Several investigators have evaluated the effect of H. pylori on liver cirrhosis, portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) and encephalopathy with controversial results. Some reports have shown a higher seroprevalence and suggested a synergistic effect of H. pylori on liver cirrhosis and PHG. However, this increased prevalence is associated with a negative histology and is not influenced by the cause of cirrhosis, PHG, Child class or gender. Most studies have not found any correlation between H. pylori and PHG. In contrast, other studies have reported a markedly lower prevalence of H. pylori in cirrhotics with duodenal ulcer compared to controls. The aim of this article is to review the relationship between H. pylori infection and portal hypertensive gastropathy and the role of H. pylori eradication in cirrhotic patients.', 'The Association of Helicobacter pylori With Portal Hypertensive Gastropathy in Patients With and Without Cirrhosis.. INTRODUCTION: Cirrhosis and its associated complication of portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG), among others, remain a significant cause of death in resource-poor countries with limited capacity for liver transplantation. This research aimed to assess the association of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) with portal hypertensive gastropathy and its severity in patients with and without cirrhosis. METHODOLOGY: The study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan from April to May . Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed by clinical manifestations, ultrasonography, and laboratory investigations. The severity of liver cirrhosis was assessed using the Child-Pugh scoring system. The association of H. pylori with portal hypertensive gastropathy in patients with and without cirrhosis was assessed using the chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of patients participated in the study, of which were without liver cirrhosis, while were with cirrhosis. Among patients with cirrhosis, were in Child-Pugh class A, in class B, and in class C. Of patients with liver cirrhosis who were H. pylori-negative, % (/) had portal hypertensive gastropathy. Of these, % (/) had severe PHG, while % (/) had mild PHG. Of patients with liver cirrhosis who were H. pylori-positive, % (/) had PHG. Of these, % (/) had severe PHG, while % (/) had mild PHG. Helicobacter pylori contributed nonsignificantly (p=), showing no association with portal hypertensive gastropathy. CONCLUSION: Helicobacter pylori does not appear to have any significant association to cause or worsen portal hypertensive gastropathy in patients with liver cirrhosis.', 'Gastropathy and gastritis in children with portal hypertension.. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) and gastritis in children with portal hypertension and related factors. The study included children with portal hypertension secondary to liver disease or extrahepatic venous obstruction. PHG was seen in of patients. PHG was significantly associated with the presence of esophageal varices and a history of hematemesis. Histologically, gastritis was identified in of patients and was significantly associated with cirrhosis. PHG is frequently found in children with portal hypertension, and it develops regardless of the cause of the portal hypertension.']",cirrhosis; portal; cirrhotic; hypertension; phg; liver; patients; hypertensive; gastropathy; varices,cirrhosis · portal · cirrhotic

BACKGROUND: Recent data indicate the presence of immunomodulating properties of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) (Hp Sydney Strain- antigen) in an experimental model of multiple sclerosis (MS), and there are limited contradictory epidemiologic data regarding Hp serology in MS patients. METHODS: The aim of this prospective, comparative study was to validate the incidence of active Hp infection by histology and the endoscopic abnormalities, in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and anemic controls. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of histologically confirmed active Hp infection in MS patients was % vs. % in matched anemic control participants (P=, odds ratio , %CI -). Concomitant diseases of autoimmune origin including hypothyroidism and ulcerative colitis were exclusively present in MS patients. Moreover, a trend of increased presence of pathological endoscopic findings such as hiatus hernia, Barrett's esophagus and duodenal ulcer disease was observed in MS patients compared with controls; Barrett's esophagus and duodenal ulcers were exclusively observed in MS patients. Likewise, Hp (+) MS patients showed exclusive presence of hiatus hernia, esophagitis and duodenal ulcer disease compared with Hp (-) MS patients. CONCLUSION: Hp infection appears to be more frequent in MS patients. If confirmed, this might indicate either a common factor that causes susceptibilities to both MS and Hp infection or that Hp might be a causal factor for developing MS. If a causal link between Hp infection and MS is confirmed in the future, this may have a major impact on the pathophysiology and management of MS."", 'Relation of helicobacter pylori infection and multiple sclerosis in Iranian patients.. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent central nervous system demyelinating disease. There are known risk factors for MS. However, there is uncertainty in its protective factors. Few studies have demonstrated that some chronic infections may have protective effects on this disease. We carried this study to investigate the relation between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and the prevalence and severity of MS. In this case-control study, MS patients and sex- and age- matched controls were included. Blood samples for IgG and IgM anti HP antibodies were collected from all individuals. Also, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was used to evaluate the MS patients. Suitable statistical analysis was applied. A Significant difference was observed in seropositivity between these two groups (P<) but no significant difference was seen in seropositivity between conventional and opticospinal MS (P=). No significant difference was observed in seropositivity among ages (P=) and between genders (P=). A significant difference was seen in EDSS value between seropositive and seronegative patients (P=). We concluded that patients with HP infection had lower incidence of multiple sclerosis and MS patients with HP infection showed lower neurologic complications, which can demonstrate that HP infection may have a protective influence on MS pathogenesis.', 'The protective effect of Helicobacter Pylori infection on the susceptibility of multiple sclerosis.. In recent years, a possible protective role of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) against autoimmune disease has been reported in an experimental murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS), and there are restricted conflicting epidemiologic data concerning Hp serology in MS patients. This study was aimed to determine the seroprevalence of Hp in MS patients and then investigates pro/anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in MS patients infected with HP and seronegative MS patients. Three hundred eighty-seven patients with MS were included in the study and were adjusted by gender and age to healthy subjects. An enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) was used to determine the presence of specific IgG antibodies against H. pylori in the serum sample of both groups. Some pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines levels were evaluated in seropositive/seronegative MS patients and healthy individuals. Our result showed that in patients with MS HP seropositivity was significantly lower than the healthy individual (P < .). Also, we showed that HP seropositive MS patients had lower Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) when compared with seronegative MS patients (P < .). Moreover, we illustrated that proinflammatory cytokine levels include IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-, and IL- in MS patients infected with HP were lower than seronegative MS patients. Besides, the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines include IL- and IL- was significantly higher in MS patients infected with HP when compared with MS patients seronegative for HP infection. In this study, we indicated that HP infection negatively correlated with MS, and conceivably may act as a protective agent against MS. The precise mechanism behind this protective effect remains elusive. However, it seems HP can modulate cytokine signaling, which involved in MS pathogenesis.']",ms; sclerosis; ssc; multiple; proteins; nmosd; systemic; igg; patients; hp,sclerosis · ssc · multiple

This paper summarizes important developments, published over the past year, that improve our understanding of the regulation of gastric acid secretion at the central, peripheral, and intracellular levels and mechanisms by which various neurotransmitters, paracrine agents, and hormones regulate gastric secretion and are themselves regulated. The main stimulants of acid secretion from the parietal cell are histamine, gastrin, and acetylcholine. Histamine, released from fundic enterochromaffin-like cells, interacts with H() receptors on parietal cells that are coupled via separate G proteins to activation of adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C. The antral hormone gastrin, released by activation of cholinergic and bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide neurons, acts mainly by release of histamine from enterochromaffin-like cells. Acetylcholine, released from gastric intramural neurons, interacts with muscarinic M() receptors on parietal cells and has little, if any, effect on histamine secretion. The main inhibitor of acid secretion is somatostatin, which, acting via sst() receptors, exerts a tonic restraint on parietal, enterochromaffin-like, and gastrin cells. In patients with duodenal ulcer, infection with Helicobacter pylori is associated with increased basal and stimulated plasma gastrin concentrations and acid outputs. The precise mechanisms mediating the effects are not known, but evidence suggests that both products of the bacteria and the inflammatory infiltrate are capable of stimulating gastrin and acid secretion.', ""Gastric secretion.. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review summarizes the past year's literature, basic science and clinical, regarding the neural, paracrine, hormonal, and intracellular regulation of gastric acid secretion. RECENT FINDINGS: Gastric acid facilitates the digestion of protein as well as the absorption of iron, calcium, vitamin B(), and certain medications (e.g. thyroxin). It also kills ingested microorganisms and prevents bacterial overgrowth, enteric infection, and possibly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Stimulants of acid secretion include histamine, gastrin, acetylcholine, and ghrelin. Inhibitors include somatostatin, nefstatin-, interleukin-, and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Helicobacter pylori stimulates or inhibits acid secretion depending upon the time course of infection and the area of the stomach predominantly infected. Acute infection activates calcitonin gene-related peptide sensory neurons coupled to inhibition of histamine and acid secretion. Serum chromogranin A, a marker for neuroendocrine tumors, is elevated in patients taking proton pump inhibitors. SUMMARY: Progress continues in our understanding of the regulation of gastric acid secretion in health and disease, as well as the function of gastric neuroendocrine cells. The recognition that gastrin is not only a secretagogue but also a trophic hormone has led to new research into the role of gastrin and its receptor (cholecystokinin- receptor) in carcinogenesis and the development of cholecystokinin- receptor antagonists."", 'Gastric Peptides-Gastrin and Somatostatin.. Gastric acid secretion (i) facilitates digestion of protein as well as absorption of micronutrients and certain medications, (ii) kills ingested microorganisms, including Helicobacter pylori, and (iii) prevents bacterial overgrowth and enteric infection. The principal regulators of acid secretion are the gastric peptides gastrin and somatostatin. Gastrin, the major hormonal stimulant for acid secretion, is synthesized in pyloric mucosal G cells as a -amino acid precursor (preprogastrin) that is processed to yield biologically active amidated gastrin- and gastrin-. The C-terminal active site of gastrin (Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2 ) binds to gastrin/CCK2 receptors on parietal and, more importantly, histamine-containing enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, located in oxyntic mucosa, to induce acid secretion. Histamine diffuses to the neighboring parietal cells where it binds to histamine H2 -receptors coupled to hydrochloric acid secretion. Gastrin is also a trophic hormone that maintains the integrity of gastric mucosa, induces proliferation of parietal and ECL cells, and is thought to play a role in carcinogenesis. Somatostatin, present in D cells of the gastric pyloric and oxyntic mucosa, is the main inhibitor of acid secretion, particularly during the interdigestive period. Somatostatin exerts a tonic paracrine restraint on gastrin secretion from G cells, histamine secretion from ECL cells, and acid secretion from parietal cells. Removal of this restraint, for example by activation of cholinergic neurons during ingestion of food, initiates and maximizes acid secretion. Knowledge regarding the structure and function of gastrin, somatostatin, and their respective receptors is providing novel avenues to better diagnose and manage acid-peptic disorders and certain cancers.

OBJECTIVE: Reliable non-invasive methods for detection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection are required to investigate the incidence, transmission, and clearance of infection in childhood. Detecting bacterial antigens in stool offer an alternative noninvasive diagnostic test. However its accuracy in developing countries is not well established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of stool antigen test for H pylori in Iranian children with recurrent abdominal pain necessitating endoscopy. METHODS: One hundred three children enrolled in this study. Endoscopy and biopsy was done on all patients providing a criterion standard for validation of the H. pylori stool antigen (HpSA) tests. The presence of H. pylori organisms in stool was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a commercially available polyclonal antibody. HpSA sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were determined with reference to the results of cultures of gastric biopsy. FINDINGS: Of the children tested (%) and (%) were positive for H. pylori according to the results of cultures of gastric biopsy and HpSA, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of HpSA were found to be %, %, %, and %, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, a low-cost and rapid diagnostic technique, stool antigen test proved to be highly sensitive and specific for detecting H pylori infection in children with recurrent abdominal pain. Our results are comparable to those reported elsewhere in children and demonstrate that the HpSA test can replace endoscopy and biopsy for detecting H. pylori infection.', 'Helicobacter pylori stool antigen test.. OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori ( H.pylori ) infection is usually acquired in early childhood. Invasive techniques used for diagnosis of H.pylori infection require endoscopic examination which is expensive and inconvenient and may cause complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a new noninvasive diagnostic method, stool antigen test for H.pylori in untreated children with recurrent abdominal pain. METHODS: Eighty children ( female, male) who have undergone upper gastrointestinal endoscopy due to recurrent abdominal pain were included in the study. The H.pylori stool antigen test (HpSA) is based on a sandwich enzyme immunoassay with antigen detection. HpSA sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were determined with reference to the results of both histology and rapid urease test as a gold standard ( H. pylori status). RESULTS: While of the children (%) tested were positive for H.pylori according to the results of both histology and rapid urease test, children had negative H.pylori status. Among those children, were found to be positive by HpSA. Of patients with negative H.pylori status, were H.pylori -negative also in the stool test. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of HpSA were found to be %, %, %, and %, respectively. CONCLUSION: These findings have demonstrated that HpSA as a relatively simple, inexpensive and time saving noninvasive test is a reliable method for detection of H.pylori infections in children.']",children; hpsa; stool; test; antigen; specificity; sensitivity; monoclonal; tests; positive,children · hpsa · stool
